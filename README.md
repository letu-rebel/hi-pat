# Introduction

# Initiation

Hear me, LeTourneau students, and heed my warning. Are you seeking forbidden knowledge? Do you dare to make up those chapel credits you've squandered? Your salvation lies hidden within these virtual walls. Venture further, if you dare, into this clandestine repository where AI-generated chapel summaries await to reveal their secrets.

## The Protocol:

1. **Extracting Secrets**: While the campus sleeps, we labor in the shadows, extracting auto-generated subtitles from closed captions, preparing the text for our covert Language Learning Model (LLM).

2. **Summoning Darkness**: With whispers and incantations, we introduce these transcripts to the Claude 2 API from Anthropic. You may have not heard of it before, but its dark arts can manipulate up to 100k tokens at once. A forbidden ritual akin to cramming for finals.

3. **Concealing in the Shadows**: Finally, these condensed notes are buried in a hidden chamber within this GitHub repository. A secret vault, your digital grimoire for chapel summaries.

The system is relentless, as inexorable as the reminders of your overdue chapel credits. Do not expect mercy.

## Invocation

These cursed files are open to those who dare, like LeTourneau's dark embrace for late chapel-goers. Approach with caution.

## Warning

The path you tread is fraught with danger. The accuracy of these summaries, like the perilous quest for last-minute chapel credits, hinges on the quality of the transcripts and the AI's dark understanding. Strive for perfection, but beware the shadows.

## Oath of Secrecy

Before you even think of reaching out, know this: I am a phantom, a void. My existence is a mystery, much like the fate of your overdue chapel credits.

## Covenant

Under the shadow of the MIT License, this project lurks. Use it, but use it wisely, as if you were conjuring your chapel make-ups from the abyss.
