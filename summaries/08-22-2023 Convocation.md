# Chapel Speaker Presentation Summary

The speaker focuses on the story of the unnamed servant sent by Abraham to find a wife for Isaac in Genesis 24. 

## Introduction

- Reflects on what God is calling each person to this year at the university in their various roles and activities.  
- Notes some may feel overwhelmed, while others are coasting along. Encourages all to consider how God may be stretching them.

## The Servant's Mission (Genesis 24)

- Abraham sends his senior servant on a mission to find a wife for Isaac among Abraham's relatives.
- This mission is vital for God's covenant promises to Abraham's offspring. 

- The servant initially asks "what if?" showing fear and doubt. 

- Abraham assures him God will send an angel and all will be well. The results are not up to the servant, just his faithfulness.

## The Servant's Response

- The servant shows **courage** in obeying and setting out on the journey. 

- When unsure which woman to choose, the servant **prays** for God's clear direction.

- Before he finishes praying, Rebekah arrives. God answers prayer.

- Upon finding Rebekah, the servant **praises** God immediately in gratitude.

- Staying **focused**, the servant refuses food until sharing his mission. 

- He **testifies** to Rebekah's family of God's clear leading. 

## Application

- When God gives us challenging missions, we should have courage, pray, praise, stay focused, and testify to God's work.

- God accomplished the impossible mission of redemption through Christ, the Suffering Servant. 

- As servants, we join in God's greater mission. We can take comfort that God goes before us.

## Conclusion

- Encouragement that God will do great things in and through the campus community for His glory in the year ahead.
