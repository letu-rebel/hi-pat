# Chapel Speaker Presentation Summary

## Introduction

- Speaker loves stories and has a vivid imagination that takes her into stories. Comes from a family of storytellers. 

- The Bible contains great stories, though often messy, that allow us to find ourselves in them. 

- As we grow, our understanding of how big God is should also grow. Speaker's understanding of faith stories has grown as she matured. 

## Speaker's Background

- Grew up on a farm in Illinois with storytelling around the dining room table. 

- Heard stories of struggle, success, despair, dreaming, reconciliation. People shared stories at uncertain junctures, seeking new perspective. 

- Saw God's presence in the stories, though parents were imperfect. Learned the power of caring for people's stories.

## The Power of Stories

- We must not only hear stories, but tell them and live them out. 

- Psalm 78 says to tell children of God's works so they will trust Him. Tell the full, gritty story.

- Our lives should show the gospel lived out authentically. Stories of how Jesus changed us are powerful.

- Consider what stories you are dwelling in and who you are giving credit to. Make sure to tell stories revealing God's glory.

## Telling Our Stories

- Some painful stories cost us something to tell but need to be shared.

- Treat half-baked stories with care. Seek wisdom in what to share. 

- If your story needs healing or repentance, get help. If you're stuck, invite others in. If grieving, find people to help remember. 

- You have a story and song. With God's help, you'll sing it again. 

## The Jailer's Story

- Paul and Silas jailed for their stories of Jesus. Sang hymns in jail. Earthquake freed them but they stayed to tell jailer about Jesus. Jailer and family baptized and celebrated. 

- We all have "still here" moments - glimpses of a different life. In the stillness we can choose a better story and celebrate over weeping. 

## Conclusion

- You are still here for a reason. If you have a pulse, you have a purpose. Discover your calling through your spheres of influence. 

- Tell the stories of God's glory. Live this risky faith. You are still here - really live the story God has for you.
