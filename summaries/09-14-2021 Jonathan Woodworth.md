## Chapel Speaker Presentation Summary

The speaker, Jonathan Woodworth, opened by sharing about his early experiences with teaching and preaching as a missionary. He was very nervous at first but has grown more comfortable over time. 

He emphasized that all Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, reproof, correction and training in righteousness (2 Timothy 3:16-17). Scripture is God-breathed.

The speaker was asked to preach on Joshua 7, which is the story of Achan's sin. He provided context by summarizing Joshua 6, where the Israelites defeated Jericho after following God's instructions to march around the city. However, God commanded that they not take any of the treasures under the ban for themselves. 

In Joshua 7, Achan secretly took some of the banned treasures, causing God's anger to burn against Israel. Joshua then sent men to spy out the next city, Ai, assuming an easy victory. But Israel was defeated at Ai, which revealed there was hidden sin. 

The speaker highlighted two sins:

1. The sin of Joshua - He did not seek God's guidance about attacking Ai but relied on his own wisdom after the victory at Jericho.

2. The sin of Achan - He directly disobeyed God by taking banned items. Our sin is always known to God.

After being defeated at Ai, Joshua cried out to God. The sin was eventually exposed by selecting men tribe by tribe until Achan was identified. Achan, his family, and possessions were stoned, burned and buried. 

The speaker emphasized we all have a sin nature and need salvation through Christ. For believers, we must walk closely with God, examining our hearts and abiding in Christ. He pleaded for unbelievers to examine Christ's claims and repent, and for believers to rededicate themselves to following God wholeheartedly.
