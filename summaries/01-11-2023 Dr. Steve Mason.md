## Chapel Speaker Presentation

The speaker, Dr. Mason, began with some lighthearted banter about going on road trips over the holidays. He shared about his own family's fondness for road trips and showed some photos from trips they had taken over the years. 

He made the comparison between road trips and the Christian life, saying they both have twists, turns, ups, downs, waiting, anticipation, joy, and pain. He asked the students to reflect on where they find themselves in their own faith journey - are they feeling lost, do they know the destination, what is their roadmap?

The speaker said his favorite part of road trips is making the playlist. He showed some of his family's road trip playlists for different destinations. He compared this to the Psalms of Ascent in Scripture - 15 songs that were like a playlist for ancient Israelites making pilgrimages to Jerusalem to worship. 

Dr. Mason walked through some of the Psalms of Ascent, highlighting the range of emotions and experiences they capture - distress, excitement, vision, restoration, hope, pain, forgiveness, hope, patience, fellowship, and praise. He invited students to read through them and identify which psalm resonates most with where they are currently at in their walk with God.

For himself, Dr. Mason shared that Psalm 127 resonates most right now. He referenced the chapel theme of being reconciled to reconcile (from 2 Corinthians 5), and said Psalm 127 captures the tension of partnering with God but relying fully on Him. The psalm highlights God's provision, protection, and posterity. 

Dr. Mason related this to his roles as a father, church elder, and university president. He said this psalm reminds him that in all efforts to build, watch, and multiply, it is God who ultimately provides, protects, and ensures a future. The students are the university's long-range strategic plan. 

He closed by praying that each person would reflect on where they are in their spiritual road trip and turn up the volume on the Psalms of Ascent playlist. He thanked God for being with us on the journey to ultimately meet Him face to face.
