## Sermon Summary

Dr. Rickovski began by asking the congregation to consider how we measure time - by minutes, hours, seasons, etc. He contrasted this with how God's people measure time differently, following the church calendar that witnesses to God's way of telling time. 

We are currently in Holy Week. This week is set aside to remember the events of Jesus' final week before his resurrection. The Gospels dedicate a large portion of text - 35-45% - to this final week, showing its significance. 

Dr. Rickovski explained the importance of Passover for Jewish people as a celebration of God's deliverance of His people from slavery in Egypt. The Exodus story shaped Jewish identity. Throughout Israel's history, Jewish writers would use Passover imagery to express hope for God's future deliverance and restoration. 

The Gospels present Jesus' life and ministry using Exodus motifs and themes, presenting Jesus as the fulfillment of a new Exodus through his life, death, and resurrection. As Jesus went to Jerusalem to die during Passover week, he transformed the meaning of Passover by connecting the bread and wine to his impending death at the cross. 

Jesus becomes the ultimate Passover lamb whose sacrifice delivers all humanity from slavery to sin and death. The Lord's Supper instituted at the Passover meal points back to Jesus' death and forward to the messianic banquet in God's future kingdom.

Dr. Rickovski closed by urging the congregation to participate in upcoming Communion services, looking back at Christ's sacrifice and looking forward to the future completion of God's redemptive work. Our hope is found in Christ's death and resurrection.
