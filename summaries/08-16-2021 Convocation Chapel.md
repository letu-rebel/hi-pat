## Chapel Speaker Presentation Summary

The speaker opened by welcoming students back to chapel after 18 months, calling it a "convocation" where the community gathers to reorient themselves to God. 

He explained that chapel is a time to cheer each other on in life's ups and downs, joys and sorrows. He gave the example of Coach Mihalski competing in the Olympic trials and showing gratitude despite coming in 4th place. The speaker emphasized we need people to cheer us on and commend us to keep running the race of life. 

The message focused on Psalm 66 which outlines how to cheer one another on:

- It's for everyone - all are commanded to shout, sing, and praise God's name

- It's a message of salvation - remembering the miracle of being saved

- It acknowledges hardships along the way - God brings us through fire, water, and abundance 

- It presses us to share gratitude - offer our time, talents, and attention back to God

- It ends with personal testimonies - telling what God has done for our own souls

The speaker said meeting weekly reorients us to God who has done these things. He noted the resurrection is our ultimate hope, without which the Psalm would not be encouraging. Just as Paul said, if Christ is not raised then faith is in vain. The resurrection is either something to mock or to want to hear more about. 

In closing, the speaker challenged listeners to respond to the resurrection and invited them to come and see and hear more about it through the weekly chapel services.
