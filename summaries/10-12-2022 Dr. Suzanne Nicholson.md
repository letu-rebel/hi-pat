## Announcements

- The LeTourneau Swing Dance Club usually holds classes on Mondays from 6:30-8:30 pm, but this week they will not meet due to fall break. Instead, they will have a lesson on Saturday, October 22nd from 4-6 pm. The club is also planning some upcoming social events.

- Spring break mission trip registrations are open. The dates for the trips are March 11-18th. The Oaxaca and Sudan Support the Sea trips are full, but they are opening up another Aviation mission trip. Students interested should look out for the mission trip signups.

# Chapel Speaker Presentation Summary

The speaker, Dr. Suzanne Nicholson, discusses Jesus' cleansing of the temple as recorded in Luke 19:45-48. 

## Introduction

- Dr. Nicholson begins with a video of a young boy incorrectly using a mop to illustrate that good intentions are not enough - we must keep the bigger purpose in mind. 

## Main Points

- In Luke 19, Jesus weeps over Jerusalem for failing to recognize the peace he offers. The Hebrew concept of peace (shalom) means wholeness and prosperity for all. 

- Jesus performs prophetic sign acts, like cleansing the temple, to illustrate God's word. 

- Jesus was angry to find the temple courts filled with animal sellers and money changers. Though they provided needed services, their presence limited Gentile worship and showed disregard for true worship of God.

- By quoting Isaiah 56:7 and Jeremiah 7:11, Jesus condemns the religious leaders for failing to care for the vulnerable and misusing the temple for economic gain. 

- The religious leaders lost sight of honoring God amidst changing circumstances. They sought to retain power and economic success rather than honor God.

- Jesus' ministry shows that true worship means bringing shalom through caring for the vulnerable. We should follow his example.

## Conclusion

- Attending chapel should lead to loving God and neighbors. If it becomes a means to an end, we are no better than the religious leaders Jesus condemned. Let us not lose sight of true worship.
