# Sermon Summary

## Introduction
- Dr. Moriello began by mentioning two prominent megachurch pastors (Bill Hybels and James McDonald) who recently resigned due to misconduct, highlighting the danger of seeking greatness rather than servanthood.

## Main Points

### Servanthood Versus Greatness
- Greatness is scaleless and can lead to abuse of power, whereas servanthood is child-sized. 

### Servanthood Welcomes and Protects
- Servanthood welcomes actual people into Christ's community, not abstractions. We must be rooted in Christ to welcome others.

- In welcoming others, we also welcome Christ. We must welcome the Christ who suffers.

- Servanthood protects those Christ sends to us. The disciples wrongly rejected someone ministering in Jesus' name. 

- Rejecting those Christ sends leads to rejecting Christ himself.

### Warning Against Seeking Greatness
- Greatness seeks self-glory and protection at the expense of others. This is the opposite of servanthood.

- Rejecting those Christ sends makes us like the Antichrist. 

## Conclusion
- We must not seek greatness but child-sized servanthood, welcoming and protecting in Jesus' name. This allows us to receive Christ and the Father.
