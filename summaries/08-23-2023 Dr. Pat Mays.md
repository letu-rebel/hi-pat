# Chapel Speaker Presentation

## Introduction
- Speaker is Dr. Pat Mays, Vice President for Student Development
- Opens by asking seniors to stand up, recognizing their upcoming graduation
- Says seniors need to create resumes summarizing accomplishments, education, experience, etc.
- In higher ed, professors create "curriculum vitae" (CVs) instead of resumes 
  - Include similar info but more detailed - publications, courses taught, projects, church/mission activity
  - CVs tend to be longer than resumes
- Speaker shows examples of lengthy CVs from himself, Dr. Scott Anson, and Dr. Mason

## Main Point - Our Credentials are Worthless Without Christ
- There is a CV example in the Bible - the Apostle Paul's letter to the Philippians
- Paul established a new church in Philippi after receiving a vision to go there
- Though he faced struggles, his visit resulted in several conversions 
- After having to leave abruptly, Paul wrote Philippians to encourage the new believers
- In Philippians 3, Paul lays out his impressive credentials and achievements
  - Circumcised on the 8th day, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews, a Pharisee, persecuted the church, righteous by the law
- Paul says all his credentials and achievements are worthless compared to knowing Christ
  - Calls them "garbage" and uses a vulgar term implying waste or dung
  - Knowing Christ is the only thing of true value
- Our credentials, achievements, CVs are also worthless without Christ
  - We can easily put confidence in our accomplishments and pride instead of Christ
- But when we fully trust Christ, the good things become truly good, bad things transformed
  - Our righteousness comes through faith in Christ, not human effort
- Paul says he counts everything as loss compared to the surpassing worth of knowing Christ
  - Willing to give up everything else to gain Christ and be found in Him

## Personal Story 
- Recent movie "Jesus Revolution" and Asbury Revival reminded speaker of when he committed to follow Christ
- In 1968 as a 2nd grader, he made an initial decision to follow Jesus
- 55 years later, he still needs to keep Christ as his #1 priority and give everything else up for Him

## Lettner's Mission Aligns
- Lettner's Statement of Faith says no education is complete until a student knows Christ
- So study hard and build your resume, but keep Christ as the essential ingredient

## Student Testimonies
- Bailey Fry and Sam Hawthorne share about when Jesus became their "one thing"
  - Accepted Christ at a young age but became real later through trials, scripture reading
  - Had to refocus on Christ multiple times after drifting away
  - Found identity, purpose, belonging, and transformation in Christ

## Closing Challenge
- Quotes Philippians 3 - Forgetting the past, straining toward what's ahead, press on toward the goal in Christ
- Speaker challenges students, faculty, staff to make Jesus their #1 priority
- It requires turning away from accomplishments and failures and making Christ the center
- Don't put off dealing with your spiritual life - talk to speaker, Bailey, Sam, or others
- Prays for community to be identified with following Jesus
