### Worship Summary

- Opening prayer by the speaker asking God to lead us and help us enjoy His love through Jesus. 

- Romans 12:1-2 was read 4 times as the theme verse for the week, urging us to offer ourselves as living sacrifices to God, be transformed and renew our minds, and discern God's will.

- The song "Truth Be Told" was a confession song acknowledging our brokenness and need for God's unconditional love and grace. 

- A prayer followed confessing our brokenness but thanking God that His love is unconditional. 

- The song "Beautiful Things" declares that God makes beautiful things out of us and makes us new. 

- The speaker led the congregation in a closing prayer from Psalm 139, asking God to search our hearts, lead us, and reveal anything idolatrous within us.


## The Speaker's Presentation

### Introduction
- This week's Spiritual Emphasis Week theme is "The Soul of Technology" - examining how our devices and social media engagement shape us.

### Technology Can Be Good But Also Deforming
- Technology and social media can be good and helpful, but can also negatively impact our lives. 

- We need to have an honest conversation about how it is forming us.

### Live Polls 
- Poll 1: Over half responded that social media and devices are *not* helping them become who they want to be.

- Poll 2: On average, people responded neutral/unsure if devices help them feel connected.

- Poll 3: The top responses for how devices make people feel were relaxed, distracted, anxious.

### God's Intention for Human Flourishing
- Reviewed the Creation-Fall-Redemption biblical framework:
  - God intends flourishing via relationships with Him, others, self, and the world.
  - The Fall distorts these relationships through brokenness.
  - Redemption in Christ restores us to God's intended flourishing.

### Measuring Technology's Impact
- Proposed evaluating technology based on if it helps us know and live out God's will.

### Questions to Consider
- Posed 7 key reflective questions for the audience to consider regarding how their technology use aligns with God's will and intention for their lives.

### Closing Prayer
- Led the congregation in praying Psalm 139 - asking God to search our hearts and reveal anything idolatrous in how we use technology.
