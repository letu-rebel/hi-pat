## Hope Greenwald's Presentation

- Hope shared about growing up in a Christian home and being saved at a young age. She grew to know Christ more deeply over time.  

- In high school, she struggled for the first time with repeated sin and deep sadness. She struggled with her identity, meaning, and direction in life. She felt distant from God.

- She had put her worth in having a "clean record." Once that was gone, she couldn't forgive herself, even though she knew God forgave her. She didn't fully understand forgiveness. 

- She emphasized that our mistakes don't define us, we're all works in progress, and we need to believe God holds our identity. She asked if we really walk in freedom or keep struggling as if irredeemable, when God says we're redeemed.

- How we view ourselves affects how we view others. Hope shared about caring too much what others think and not wanting to speak in chapel out of fear of failure. 

- She said we need to love others as God loves us, see our own imperfections before judging others, and view others through God's eyes.

- Our view of self and others affects how we view the world. Hope admitted sometimes just going through the motions and dreading days. She said her mission is to glorify God, though she has a limited understanding of what that means. 

- She closed emphasizing needing continual renewal through Christ to have the right perspective on self, others, and the world.

## Zach Hash's Presentation

- Zach grew up in a Christian home, loved Jesus from a young age, rededicated his life at 11, and got baptized. His family later switched churches, where he had powerful encounters with the Holy Spirit.

- In college he struggled with depression, lust, and self-condemnation. He cried out to God one night and had an encounter where he felt Christ's deep love and care.

- Zach emphasized the importance of pouring out your heart to God in pressing times and encountering Christ's love.

- He had an experience of pausing to let Jesus love him when he was burnt out, and realized the necessity of resting in Christ's presence. 

- Zach attended the Asbury Revival and felt convicted to fully surrender everything to Christ again. He learned keys to hosting God's presence are weakness before God and lingering with Christ.

- Zach closed challenging students to continually lay everything down before Christ, gaze at Him, remain in His love, and linger in His presence.
