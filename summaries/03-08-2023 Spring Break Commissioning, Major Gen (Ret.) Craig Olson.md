## Speaker Presentation Summary

Mr. Craig Olson shared about his personal journey of reconciliation with God and how it has unfolded over many years. 

### Becoming a Believer

- Was raised in church but had no personal relationship with God
- In college, a friend named Richard Burgess invited him to a Bible study which introduced him to having a personal relationship with Jesus
- Made the decision to accept Christ as his savior in April 1979 during a college trip 
- Began exploring what it means to live for God's kingdom rather than himself

### Learning Dependence on God 

- Struggled academically in college despite hard work
- Realized he had been relying on his own strength rather than God
- Surrendered control and made a prayer of dependence on God
- Saw a dramatic improvement in grades, which grew his faith in God's power

### Reconciliation as a Lifelong Journey 

- Difficult trials and opportunities in life can be used by God for growth
- Over time, he learned to see purpose in trials and rejoice in what God was doing
- His faith and dependence on God grew continuously through life experiences
- True joy comes from seeing how God uses difficulties for good purposes

### The Importance of Prayer

- Prayer fuels the reconciled life; it's communicating with God to build the relationship
- Learned to pray continually throughout each day, not just at set times
- Various postures of prayer (kneeling, laying down, etc) reflect the heart attitude
- Praying brings wisdom, strength, guidance, and draws us closer to God

### Making God Central in Work 

- Be careful not to let career pursuits crowd out family relationships
- He learned to see his work as a mission field and involve family more
- Now investing in students and faculty at LeTourneau to help their faith journeys

- In summary, reconciliation with God is a lifelong journey fueled by prayer, learning dependence, and making God central in all of life's pursuits.
