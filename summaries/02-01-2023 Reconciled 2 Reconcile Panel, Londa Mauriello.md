- The worship leader closed the worship time in prayer again, thanking God for being a good Father who redeems us, for the sacrifice of Jesus, and asking God to speak through the speakers' messages. The overall spirit was one of gratitude for God's grace, mercy and reconciliation.


## Speaker Presentation Summary

Moreyella introduced the speakers Dr. Jim Taylor and Dr. Mark Mullen, who both came to Christ as adults and will share their stories of reconciliation with Christ. 

### Dr. Mark Mullen

- Reconciliation involves recognizing there is a real wrong or separation from God. We were enemies of God before Christ died for us. 

- We have to accept Christ as he is and what he's done since we can't save ourselves.

### Dr. Jim Taylor

- He grew up in an Ivy League family where God was not present. His parents divorced when he was young. 

- His father introduced him to drugs at age 14. He was rebellious, doing drugs and playing in a rock band in high school. 

- He had a traumatic LSD experience at 17 that left him lonely and mixed up. He decided to hitchhike across America to "find himself."

- He hit rock bottom hitchhiking and felt desperately lonely. Some Christian kids invited him to a church event which he attended. He saw a warmth and acceptance in them that attracted him.

- At a sunrise service, the preacher said giving your life to Christ will fill the hole in your heart. Jim raised his hand and was baptized, never looking back. He got involved in a Christian community which grounded his newfound faith.

### Dr. Mark Mullen

- He grew up in California with social worker parents. They occasionally went to church but he didn't know much about God or Christ. 

- In high school he wanted to find Jesus' bones since he didn't understand the resurrection. No one corrected his misunderstanding.

- At the Coast Guard Academy he was full of pride but found it very humbling. He wasn't a great friend or classmate.

- Some classmates invited him to Christian Fellowship but he declined, thinking he'd have to give up his plans and intellect to believe.

- Facing death in a thunderstorm while hiking, he prayed to God for a chance to seek Him if he survived.

- At a Carmen concert, the speaker's history of faith in America resonated with Mark. He realized he could trust Christ like the historical figures he admired.

- He ran down at the altar call to receive Christ.

### On Reconciling Issues After Conversion

- Dr. Mullen: He got burned out on repetitive church services. He read old Christian books which reinvigorated his faith, showing the depth and history of Christianity.

- Dr. Taylor: He believes in spiritual disciplines like reciting God's attributes daily to stay grounded when storms come. Old Christian books and creeds also keep him focused on God. 

### Stories of Reconciliation

- Dr. Mullen: His pastor and a neighboring black pastor had never spoken in 8 years despite having their churches across the street. They reconciled their congregations into fellowship, ministering together.

- Dr. Taylor: A deacon confessed publicly to adultery. The pastor had him confess before the church and ask forgiveness rather than expelling him, modeling God's grace.
