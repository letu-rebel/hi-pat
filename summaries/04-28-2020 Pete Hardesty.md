## Chapel Speaker Presentation

The speaker, Pete Hardesty, shared 3 key realities to help the congregation follow Jesus for the long haul and live with joy and a bulletproof identity:

### 1. Your Identity is Received, Not Achieved

- Our identity comes from being born or adopted into God's family, not from our achievements. 

- We often try to add to our identity in Christ by achieving things like good grades, ministry involvement, etc. But this contaminates the gospel message.

- Jesus plus anything equals nothing. Jesus plus nothing equals everything. 

### 2. Your Identity is Discovered, Not Created 

- Our worth comes from Jesus' performance credited to us, not our own performance. 

- God loves us unconditionally with the same love He has for Jesus. This never changes.

- We often look to other things like following the rules to feel loved by God. But there's nothing we can do to make Him love us more or less.

### 3. God is Delighted in You

- God feels about us the way He feels about Jesus - complete love and delight.

- Our worth is not determined by our performance, but by Jesus' performance credited to us. 

- God was well pleased with Jesus before He had done anything in public ministry. This applies to us too.

- We often feel God is disappointed in us. But He has delighted in us from the very beginning.

In closing, the speaker encouraged cultivating habits like silence and solitude, taking risks to experience God's love, and surrendering to His love.
