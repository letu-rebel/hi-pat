## Chapel Speaker Presentation

Reverend Rick Durrance continues his message from previous days about making Jesus our "one thing" based on Matthew 6:33 ("But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well"). 

He notes that Jesus talked about the kingdom of God more than any other topic - it was constantly on His mind and should be for us. 

Durrance asks how we respond to Jesus' call to "repent" at the start of His ministry. Durrance shares his initial negative associations with "repent" but came to realize it is an invitation to "change the way you've been thinking." God loves this broken world and invites us to see and think differently about His kingdom reality. 

Durrance offers 3 additional characteristics of God's kingdom:

- It is **present** - here and now, though not yet fully revealed. We can emphasize the "already" while still anticipating the "not yet."

- It is **abundantly available** - not limited or scarce. Despite our inadequacies, God's kingdom resources are available to live into the fullness we were created for. 

- It is **unshakable** - while the world shakes, God's kingdom remains firm as seen in Jesus' victory over sin and death. 

In contrast, the world promotes messages of absence, scarcity, and unreliability. Durrance warns against escapism but says we must have discernment. 

He shares "mantras" to renew our thinking about who we are (delighted in by God) and where we live (God's abundant kingdom). We must regularly repent/change how we think to see our true God for the sake of the hurting world. 

Durrance closes urging people to trust and set their hearts on God's kingdom reality as their "one thing." Then all else will fall into place.
