# Speaker Presentation Summary

## Speaker Introduction
- The speaker was Dr. Lillian Jasper, president of Women's Christian College in Chennai, India

- Women's Christian College was founded in 1915 by 12 missionary societies to provide higher education for women in India
- The college imparts Christian values along with academic training
- Dr. Jasper has helped maintain high standards at the college as president

## Opening
- Dr. Jasper brought greetings from Women's Christian College and thanked Letourneau for the partnership between the schools
- She opened in prayer, committing the time to God

## Life as a Journey
- Dr. Jasper drew a parallel between human life and a journey with resting places provided by God
- Journeys symbolize hope, freedom, relaxation, and rejuvenation
- They can also bring fear at times
- The best journeys are guided by someone who knows the place and can provide the best experience
- God is the guide on the journey of life
- When we entrust our lives to God, the journey becomes fulfilling

## Going Beyond Limits
- Dr. Jasper told the story of Elisha telling a widow to borrow empty jars to fill with oil - the oil multiplied supernaturally as she poured, based on how many jars she borrowed
- God has unlimited supply, we limit our vision and must move to new pathways of increase beyond past barriers

## Personal Journey
- Dr. Jasper grew up in a Christian family and accepted Christ at a young age
- As a teenager she sought fulfillment in other things until realizing her relationship with God
- She learned to trust God fully even while dreaming big 
- She came from a conservative family but that did not stop her from dreaming big as God led her

## Empowerment for Destiny
- Ordinary tools like a slingshot can be empowered by God's anointing to fulfill destiny
- God uses willing people who trust in Him over the super talented

## College Leadership
- Dr. Jasper was chosen to lead Women's Christian College, a prestigious century-old institution
- With God's favor, no weapon formed against it has prospered
- The college has grown from 7 faculty and 41 students to over 4,500 women students today

## Nature's Renewal
- Dr. Jasper finds renewal in nature, taking students on jungle trips for her Eco-Literature course
- She told a story of seeing a tiger up close in a national park thanks to a passionate guide
- Our shared spaces become meaningful when we are in tune with God's guidance

## Staying Alert
- Dr. Jasper told of her trip to see tarsiers, tiny endangered monkeys, in the Philippines
- She explained that lack of awareness caused native people to see them as evil until realizing their value
- Discernment is important in the Christian walk to find God's will and not be deceived

## Finding True Meaning
- Dr. Jasper warned that some Westerners come to India seeking solace but get into impropriety and abuse
- Things like yoga and meditation are touted as spiritual but can open one's mind to evil forces
- One must seek what is right, not just what appears attractive

## Living Out Identity
- As kings and priests unto God, we must live out our identity and purpose for influence
- We are planted in workplaces for a reason, at every point given resting places to rejuvenate

## Long-Term Perspective 
- We must reject exhaustion and depression and seek God's resting places
- Our talents should not be used just to gain possessions but to invest in eternity

## Relationships and Rest
- Heart-centered leaders run profitable businesses; we must invest in relationships
- Rest is a weapon God has given; blessings come in His timing

## Faithfulness in Storms  
- Dr. Jasper told a story of a farmer hiring a hand who could "sleep through a storm" 
- The hand did his work faithfully so when a storm came, he was not afraid
- When we do our work loyally when skies are clear, we are prepared for storms

## The Journey
- Dr. Jasper concluded by asking all to reflect on their journey and whether they have surrendered to God who brings resting places
