### Mental Health Presentation Summary

#### Statistics
- 1 in 5 American adults have a diagnosable mental health condition each year  
- 50% of Americans will meet criteria for a mental health disorder at some point in their life
- Half of those develop a condition by age 14
- Depression affects 300 million people worldwide
- Suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death for ages 10-34

#### Pandemic Impact
- Mental health issues from pandemic are worse than the disease itself  
- 25% increase in mental health issues globally since 2020 pandemic
- 76.2 million more people with depression and 53.2 million more with anxiety disorders due to pandemic 

#### No Easy Solutions  
- Life and problems are complex, no magic solutions
- Counseling helps but doesn't solve everything  
- Problem is looking for easy fixes, but must accept complexity

#### Social Support Helps
- Decades of research shows social support improves mental health
- It is like "kryptonite" against mental disorders
- Involves quality, healthy relationships with each other

#### Biblical Basis
- Jesus commanded his disciples to "love one another"
- Numerous "one another" passages in New Testament
- Early church growth partly due to radical community 

#### Barriers to Community
- Online relationships don't provide enough support
- Complexity makes relationships difficult
- Risk involved in vulnerability  
- Past hurts freeze us from new relationships
- Labels oversimplify and limit us
- "Lauterano syndrome" - belief we are too unique for relationships
- Lack of self-care prevents healthy relating

#### Main Point
- We must awaken the "sleeping giant" of social support despite discomfort 
- Engage in deep relationships and one-anothering to win the mental health war
- Endure discomfort to connect meaningfully, turn off devices  
- Resources are amongst each other if we engage
