## Chapel Speaker Presentation

### Introduction
- The speaker was Vice President Steve Kahn
- He introduced the topic of leadership and noted there are many perspectives on what it means
- He stated he would offer some thoughts and examples from Scripture about leadership 

### Main Points

- Not all service is leadership
    - Serving and leadership overlap but are not the same 
    - Serving has inherent value on its own, not just when called "leadership"
    - Jesus served in humble ways like washing feet, but also led boldly in public

- Bible examples of leaders who served
    - Moses was reluctant but accepted the call to lead and serve Israel
    - David eagerly stepped up to face Goliath and serve Israel 
    - Esther risked her life to go before the king and save her people  

- Letourneau students should be ready and willing to lead
    - Students are often humble and hard-working, which are great qualities
    - But they shouldn't be afraid to seek out leadership roles when needed
    - There are many opportunities to lead on campus as an RA, team captain, club leader, etc.
    - Not everyone will have an official title, but all can lead through service

- Leadership should be joyful and a service to others
    - Leaders should focus on the needs of their people, not themselves
    - Leadership is a way to serve others, so it should be enjoyed
    - At times it may require sacrifice, but the focus is still on serving
  
### Conclusion
- The speaker encouraged students to look for ways to lead through service
- He noted that not everyone will have an official leadership role 
- But all can ask God if there are ways they can serve the community
- He closed in prayer asking for God's guidance and help
