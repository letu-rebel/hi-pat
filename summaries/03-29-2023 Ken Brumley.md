## Speaker Presentation Summary

The speaker, Ken Brumley, emphasized making an impact in the world before you die. 

He said at funerals, people only talk about two things - your titles/accomplishments or your testimony and impact on others' lives.

To make an impact, you must:

- **Give up your sanity** - Don't try to be logical to the world. Embrace God's "upside down" wisdom. Be willing to look foolish to follow Jesus. 

- **Learn to play with pain** - Expect and embrace opposition and trials as building perseverance. See pain as resistance to living God's truth. Don't complain about struggles, see them as opportunities. 

- **Live with gratitude** - Be thankful in all circumstances. Gratitude decreases depression and stress, improves health, and changes brain wiring. Look for people to thank. Receive thanks graciously.

In summary, give up worldly wisdom, embrace trials, and live thankfully to impact the world for Christ.
