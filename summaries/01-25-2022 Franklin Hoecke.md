# Summary of Chapel Presentation

## Speakers: Franklin and Emily, Letourneau Alumni

### Seven Bad Reasons Not to Be a Missionary

1. You need a "real job" 
    - Being a missionary is an amazing job - get to talk about Jesus, make friends, experience new cultures
2. You have college debt 
    - Many think they can pay off debt with a regular job but not as a missionary - this makes no sense
    - Organizations exist to help pay off debt for aspiring missionaries 
3. Your parents don't approve
    - Jesus deserves our obedience over pleasing parents  
    - Must obey God's calling first even if it disappoints parents
4. You have a specific degree
    - Most people don't end up in careers related to their college major
    - Don't let your degree hold you back from missions if it's your heart's desire
5. The American Dream
    - American Dream of big house and possessions is unbiblical and evil
    - Jesus calls us to leave everything and follow him
    - Pouring resources into missions could finish the Great Commission  
6. Fear of not getting married
    - Staying single is better than disobeying God's call
    - More single women than men in missions - guys should just go
7. Haven't heard a direct call from God
    - Many wait for a dramatic calling from God but this isn't necessary
    - Isaiah volunteered himself by saying "Here am I, send me"
    - If you know God's love, you are qualified to accept his invitation

### Encouragement Despite Doubts and Questions

- Doubts and questions don't disqualify you from missions
- Wrestling with doubts can lead to greater intimacy with God 
- Jesus is found among the brokenhearted - go there to find him
- Surround yourself with diversity to know Jesus more

### Closing Thoughts

- Expressed love for the students
- Challenged them to consider radical obedience to God's call over the typical American life path
- Invited students to talk with them afterwards
