### Student Testimony (Will Manchester)
- Will shares about his summer internship and how he was able to openly live out his faith. He was able to share the gospel multiple times. 

- He emphasizes being skillful at your work as an avenue for sharing your faith. Letourneau provides both excellent technical skills and discipleship.

- Closes in prayer thanking God and asking him to use the testimony.

### Faculty Speaker (Dr. Paul DeShais)
- Speaks about seeing God as a designer and engineer. 

- Draws parallels between the engineering design process and the Christian life/becoming a Christian. Clarifying the problem (sin), developing concepts (investigating religions), selecting a solution (salvation through Christ), then applying/building/testing the concept (growing as a Christian).

- Introduces idea of "model year Christian" - improving and refining your faith each year.

### Community Prayer Time
- Faculty and staff come forward and Dr. Rodriguez represents them, praying for the students. Asks for hearts for the nations and fulfilling God's call.

- Student Savannah Orton represents students, praying for unity and for faculty/staff to have eyes up, knees down in service. 

### Closing Song
- The Doxology is sung


## Faculty Speaker - Dr. Paul DeShais

### God as a Designer 

- Dr. DeShais suggests viewing God as a designer and engineer rather than just a creator.

- If there was an "Engineer's Bible", Genesis 1:1 would say "In the beginning God designed and built the heavens and the earth." This relates more directly to engineers.

### The Design Process and Christian Life

- He draws parallels between the engineering design process and the Christian life:

- Clarifying the Task: The problem is sin and separation from God. We need salvation.

- Developing Concepts: Investigate religions and worldviews for solutions. See that salvation through Christ is free.

- Selecting a Solution: Choose to become a Christian by accepting Christ.

- Embodying the Concept: Grow and build your Christian life. Apply your faith.

### Model Year Christian

- Introduces the idea of a "model year Christian" - like model year for a vehicle.

- Each year we should improve and refine our faith - "upgrade" to the next version/model year of our Christian life.

- Assess where you are now, make goals for improvement, and build the next "version" of your faith.
