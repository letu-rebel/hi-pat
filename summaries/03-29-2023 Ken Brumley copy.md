## Speaker Presentation

The speaker, Ken Brumley, emphasized making an impact in the world through living differently than the world's standards. 

He said that when people die, their funerals focus on two things - their titles/accomplishments and their personal testimony/impact on others. He challenged students to consider their impact.

Brumley gave three ways to make an eternal impact:

### Give Up Your Sanity

- Don't try to be logical by the world's standards. God's wisdom is very different. 

- The message of the cross seems foolish to the world. Follow God's upside-down wisdom.

- Your life and choices will seem abnormal and illogical to the world if you follow Jesus. Don't try to blend in.

### Learn to Play with Pain 

- Expect and anticipate opposition, disappointment, rejection, and misunderstanding. Embrace it.

- Building character requires persevering through resistance and opposition. 

- See pain and resistance as signs you are living out truth the world rejects. Don't complain about struggles.

### Live with Gratitude

- Scientists find gratitude decreases depression, stress, and anxiety while improving health. 

- Thankfulness changes brain wiring. Expressing gratitude recognizes value in others.

- Practice daily thankfulness to God and others. This gratitude makes an impact on the world.

Brumley concluded by urging students to give up worldly thinking, embrace struggles, and live thankfully to make an eternal impact through their lives.
