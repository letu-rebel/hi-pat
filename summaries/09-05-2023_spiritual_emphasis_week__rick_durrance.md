## Chapel Speaker Presentation Summary

Rick Durrance began by reminding the students of the "one thing" theme from Matthew 6:31-33 about seeking first the kingdom of God. 

He quoted N.T. Wright's observation that Jesus was a generally happy person, despite also knowing sorrow and grief at times. Rick wondered what made it possible for Jesus to live with such joy and hope. 

He suggested it was Jesus' relationship with the Father, revealed throughout his life and the New Testament, though not explicit in Matthew 6. Rick read the Luke 11:9-13 passage to illustrate God the Father's goodness and highlight the Trinity.

Rick's three insights on the Trinity:

- The Honor Within the Godhead: The Holy Spirit honors the Father and Son, Jesus honors the Father, and the Father honors the Son. The honor flows freely, not coercively.

- The Delight of the Godhead: The Trinity shares perfect relationships of delight, like a dance, which ancient writers called "perichoresis." This is the reality of the kingdom of God. 

- The Welcome of the Godhead: We are welcomed into the dance and delight of the Trinity. God is crazy in love with us and invites us in. Romans 8 says we are adopted as God's children.

Rick emphasized the healthy relational dynamics in the Trinity - no enmeshment or codependence. This models the kind of emotional and relational health humans long for, as we are created in God's image. 

He offered two miracles of being welcomed into the Trinity's dance:

1) We don't mess it up or disrupt the perfect community when we enter in. In fact, it helps us grow in our human relationships.

2) We don't get absorbed and lose ourselves, but rather become more fully ourselves, the humans we are created and redeemed to be.

In closing, Rick invited surrender to the reality of the kingdom of God found in the Trinity. He called for receiving the invitation to the dance of the Father, Son, and Spirit. This is the one thing we are to seek first.
