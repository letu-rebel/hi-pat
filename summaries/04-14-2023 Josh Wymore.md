# Humbler Leadership

## Introduction
- The speaker is Josh Wymore, a 2008 graduate of LeTourneau University. He now runs a consulting company focused on leadership training.
- Recently published his first book called "Humbler Leadership". 
- Will be speaking about the importance of humility as the foundation of good leadership, despite it not being discussed much.
- Shares a story from his college days about learning the power of humble leadership from his softball coach. This ignited his interest in the topic.

## The Research Case for Humility
- Identified 4 pillars of humble leadership from research:
  - Accurate self-perception - understanding your strengths and limitations
  - Appreciating others' strengths and contributions
  - Growth mindset - focus on improving, not proving yourself
  - Greater purpose - not thinking less of yourself, but thinking of yourself less

- These qualities feed into each other to create humble leaders.

## The Biblical Case for Humility 
- Jesus provides the ultimate model of humility, even though he had every right to be self-centered.
- Jesus embodied the 4 pillars:
  - Embraced his role in the Trinity, submitting to the Father
  - Wanted his followers to surpass him and do greater things
  - Was process-focused, not performance driven
  - Submitted fully to the greater purpose of God
- We should pursue humility because Jesus was humble, not because of low self-esteem.

## Becoming Humbler
- One practice is the "humility paradox" - being both confident in your strengths and aware of your limitations.
- Holding these two truths in tension creates humility.

## Conclusion
- Challenges listeners with two questions:
  1. If Jesus was humble, what right do I have to be self-centered?
  2. If humility is so powerful, what will you do about it?
- Encourages taking practical steps to become humbler.
