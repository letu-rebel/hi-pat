## Chapel Speaker Presentation

### Scripture Engagement
- Scripture engagement is interacting with the biblical text in a way that allows the text to speak for itself through the power of the Holy Spirit. This enables us to hear God's voice and see how Scripture applies to our lives. 

- It involves marinating in, reflecting on, and dwelling in Scripture. This leads to a transformative engagement with God. 

- Scripture engagement is quality time spent with God and his Word. It is more than just reading - it requires guidance in how to properly interact with Scripture.

### Types of Scripture Engagement
- Reading Scripture aloud
- Memorizing verses 
- Acting out parables
- Praying Scripture 
- Journaling responses to Scripture
- Public reading of Scripture 

### Scripture's Portrayal of Itself
- Scripture tells us to hide it in our hearts, impress it on our children, meditate on it, eat it, delight in it. This shows Scripture is meant to be interacted with actively and intimately.

### Holy Week Scripture Readings
- This week there will be public readings of the four Gospels on campus. 

- The speaker explains the significance of each Gospel and what to listen for in the readings. 

- He encourages students to take time to listen to and engage with the readings this week as we journey to the cross.

### Conclusion
- Scripture points us to Christ. Proper engagement with it helps us participate fully in Christ's kingdom. 

- We are called to hear and obey the Word, not just comprehend it intellectually. Scripture should lead us to follow Christ in new life.
