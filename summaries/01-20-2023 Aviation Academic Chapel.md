## Chapel Speaker Presentation Summary

### Introduction

- Mr. Ken McKenzie thanks the host for the introduction. He is grateful to Dr. Mason, Fred, and Aaron Abbott for inviting him to speak about how aviation and faith have shaped his life and career. 

### Life as an Aviation Professional

- Aviation is a challenging industry that requires strong skills. Students are acquiring those skills for future careers. The most important skill is spelling, he jokes. 

### Planning with God 

- James 4:13-17 teaches not to boast about plans but submit them to God's will. We should say "if the Lord wills" when making plans. 

- McKenzie's career took unexpected turns he didn't plan on, but sees God's hand directing him. He encourages planning with God through prayer.

### Don't Presume on Tomorrow

- James 4 and Proverbs 27 warn not to presume on the future. Life is brief and uncertain.

- McKenzie says to live each day to the fullest because life is a gift and an adventure. Don't wait for someday. 

### Do What You Know is Right Now 

- Proverbs 3:27-28 teaches not to withhold good deeds when it's in your power to act.

- McKenzie's plane crash taught him to value each day and act on things he knew were right. He later left corporate aviation to lead the Museum of the Bible.

### In Closing

- Jeremiah 29:11 promises God has good plans to prosper us. McKenzie encourages the students to keep seeking God's will as they start careers in aviation.
