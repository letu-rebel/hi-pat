## Speaker 1: Emily Quintanilla

### Main Points

- Emily shared how her family and her grandmother's example showed her the importance of relying on God's strength. 

- She discussed how pride can hinder us from relying fully on God's strength. Humans are weak and were created to be filled by God.

- Emily emphasized that God's strength is made perfect in human weakness. She referenced 2 Corinthians 12 where Paul boasts in his weaknesses so that the power of Christ may rest on him. 

- She encouraged the audience to ask themselves "Where is my faith?" when doubting or struggling. Is our faith in our circumstances or fully in Christ?

- Emily concluded by saying that relying on God as our strength allows us to see pain through His perspective. It gives reason for hope and purpose in life.

## Speaker 2: Levi Bransford 

### Main Points

- Levi used an illustration of a rope representing our eternal existence, with life on earth being a small part. He cautioned against getting consumed with temporary things versus eternity.

- He suggested our priorities drive our actions and reflect our hearts. Levi then told the story of Ruth and Boaz as examples of people who lived purposefully and selflessly.

- Levi admitted transitions and change can be scary, but encouraged the audience to be intentional about priorities and keeping God first. 

- He recommended making a list of values and keeping it visible as a reminder of what's most important when struggling or straying. 

- Levi closed by saying following Jesus is not just duty but joy. He encouraged focusing on God's unchanging nature during life's transitions.
