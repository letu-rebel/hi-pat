## Main Points

### How this passage should change our understanding of ourselves

- We have died with Christ (v.14)
- We died to sin, whose wages is death (Rom 6:23) 
- But Christ died so we can have life (v.14-15)
- Our life is now for Christ (v.15)  
- We were once "in the flesh" but no longer (v.16)
- "Flesh" means we followed the devil and sinful desires (Eph 2:1-5)
- But God made us alive in Christ (Eph 2:5)
- We are new creations in Christ (v.17)
- Our old selves have passed away

### How we should act differently

- We should not identify people by their sins (v.16)
- We should love others and not keep record of wrongs (1 Cor 13:4-5)
- No condemnation remains for us (Rom 8:1) 
- Jesus bore God's wrath for our sins (1 Pet 1:16)
- The law is satisfied in us because of Christ (Rom 8:1-4)
- We must not regard anyone according to the flesh
- We must release others and let Jesus redeem relationships

## Closing Thoughts
- Asks listeners to consider what God has done and who they need to release
- Spend time reflecting before communion
- Emphasizes we are free in Christ
