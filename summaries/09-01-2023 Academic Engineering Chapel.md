## T-Shaped Engineers
- Discussed the idea of T-shaped engineers
    - Vertical line of "T" represents depth in technical skills
    - Horizontal line represents breadth in other skills like communication, teamwork, ethics
    - Lowercase "t" on top represents relationship with God which should be above all else
- Connected the T-shape model to the biblical creation story 
    - God created the world and gave everything a purpose
    - He put all of creation in right relationship to one another
    - This reflects the need for both technical skills and relationship skills

- God should be present in all aspects of life and education
