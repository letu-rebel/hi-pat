## Presentation Summary

### Introduction

- Mr. Olson has been on the engineering faculty at LeTourneau for 5.5 years
- He is a retired Air Force Major General with 34 years of service
- He flew over 1900 hours in 20 aircraft types as a weapons systems officer and electronic warfare officer
- He attended Air Force test pilot school and conducted flight tests on new aircraft like the F-15E Strike Eagle
- He was involved in developing major aircraft projects like the E-8 Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (Joint STARS), the V-22 Osprey tiltrotor, and more

### Faith Journey 

- Mr. Olson became a Christian in 1979 during his freshman year at the Air Force Academy after being invited to a Bible study by a friend
- He struggled academically at the Academy and had to depend on God's help to improve his grades, learning to give up control and rely on God
- Every difficult experience in his life grew his faith and dependence on God

### Air Force Flying Career

- After training, he flew operationally for 12 years in aircraft like the F-4 and F-15 in places like North Carolina, Germany, and California
- He loved flying and rejoiced in it as a gift from God to pursue his passion 

### V-22 Osprey Development

- In 2002 he began working on the troubled V-22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft development program
- The program had huge cost overruns, schedule delays, crashes, and broken trust between all involved
- He had to lead the program despite no experience with helicopters, tiltrotors, the Marines, or Air Force Special Ops
- He prayed constantly for God's help and connected with other believers involved in the program
- In 3 years they fixed design flaws, rebuilt trust, and began full production of the aircraft
- He learned nothing is impossible for God and dependence on God is essential

### Lessons Learned

- Every trial in his life grew his faith and allowed God to use that experience later
- Building relationships and trust was key to the V-22's success 
- He focused completely on his work and neglected his family during the V-22 development
- Looking back, he wished he had been more present with his family instead of just giving quick advice
- Now he focuses on discovery through presence - listening and understanding without just quoting verses
- His relationship with his family today is closer than ever before

### Conclusion 

- Mr. Olson closed urging students to pursue the gifts and passions God has given them in aviation
- He encouraged them to let their work testify about God as they go out as missionaries in the aviation field
