## Sermon Summary

### Speaker Introduction
- Speaker is Carlos Ballestas, Minister of Multiplication and Missions at New Beginnings Baptist Church in Longview
- Originally from Colombia, went to seminary in Uruguay and Argentina
- Came to the US for a 2-week visit 6 years ago and has been here since 
- Married with 2 daughters

### Sermon Title & Theme
- Title: One Thing
- Theme: Knowing Christ as our one purpose in life

### Main Points
1. Where are you now?
    - We must examine where we currently are in our spiritual journey
    - This self-examination is key, as Paul does not consider himself to have "arrived"
    - We should not compare ourselves to others, but to Christ
2. What's next? 
    - Our past does not define us, it displays God's grace
    - We must forget what is behind and strain towards what is ahead
    - We must surrender areas of weakness and pursue growth
3. What is your one thing?
    - What are you pressing on towards in life? Our deepest desires?
    - If we are to live a life of purpose for God, He must be our one thing
    - Paul's one thing was knowing Christ
    - Polycarp's one thing was serving Christ for 86 years
    - Jesus' one thing was humbling himself and obeying the Father even to death
    
### Conclusion
- We must make knowing and becoming like Jesus our one thing
- This will transform our lives and allow us to live abundantly
