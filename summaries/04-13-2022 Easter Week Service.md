Dr. Julius Wong preached a sermon explaining how Christ is the Passover Lamb, connecting the Passover story from Exodus to Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection.

- As a trained Jew and former Pharisee, Paul was familiar with the Passover festival commemorating Israel's exodus from Egypt. 

- God delivered Israel from slavery through 10 plagues meant to demonstrate His power and superiority over Egyptian gods. 

- Before the final plague, God instituted Passover - Israelites were to sacrifice a lamb and put its blood on their doorposts so God would "pass over" them. 

- The Exodus shaped Israel's identity and Passover became an annual feast to remember God's deliverance.

- Passover was not just about past events, but also present struggles and future hopes of deliverance. 

- When prophets spoke of Israel's future redemption, they utilized Passover imagery. 

- The Gospels portray Jesus' ministry using Exodus motifs and themes. His death occurred during Passover week.

- At the Last Supper, Jesus connected Passover elements like bread and wine to His impending death, reinterpreting their meaning. 

- Jesus is the ultimate Passover Lamb whose blood delivers us from sin and death. His resurrection proves death is not the end.

- Paul calls Jesus "our Passover" because His sacrifice transforms death into life for those who believe.
