# Worship Section Summary

- The chapel opened with a prayer asking God to help the congregation live peacefully, devote each day to Jesus, and give glory to God in everything. 

- The worship team led the congregation in singing several songs:

  - "Walls" - About God's power to tear down walls through praise and glorifying his name

  - "Open Up My Eyes" - Asking God to open our eyes to see the way He does

  - "Way Maker" - Praising God as the way maker, miracle worker, promise keeper, and light in the darkness

  - "Even When" - Affirming that God is always working even when we can't see or feel it

  - "Grace Upon Grace" - Thanking God for his overflowing grace and forgiveness

- There were additional times of prayer and reflection, acknowledging God's presence, asking Him to speak through the speaker, and thanking God for who He is.

- The overall sentiment during worship was one of praise, gratitude, and devotion to God. The congregation engaged wholeheartedly, singing loudly and focusing on God's character and work in their lives.


# Chapel Speaker Presentation Summary

## Introduction

- Speaker is Dr. Walter Strickland, professor at Southeastern Seminary. 
- He wants to talk about connecting the gospel with our work and vocations. Many people struggle to see this connection.

## Common Misunderstandings About Work

- Work is a necessary evil
- It's all about the money
- It's for self-fulfillment and identity

- But work was created good by God. We shouldn't look to work for identity and fulfillment, but find those in God.

## Two Divides That Separate Work and Worship

### Sunday-Monday Divide

- Our society says God can only speak authoritatively in our prayer closets, not at work. 

- But we should put all spaces under Christ's lordship, including work.

### Pulpit-Pew Divide 

- Some think only "clergy" do real ministry. 

- But Scripture shows all are equipped for service and building up the church.

## Biblical Perspectives on Work

- God worked in creation. We are made in His image to also work.

- Humans were given the job of cultivating and keeping the earth.

- After the Fall, work was cursed and its trajectory bent toward self, not God.

- But work can still be redemptive, as shown in Ruth and Boaz's story.

## Key Points

- Our work should glorify God and serve others, not pursue self-fulfillment. 

- We should use our gifts to serve the church, family, and community, not just our jobs.

- Be wary of distortions like overwork. Rest helps us know we are not our work.

- See your daily work as part of God's bigger story and reflecting His character.

## Conclusion

- Praying that we would steward our gifts for God's glory in all areas of life, tearing down false divides.
