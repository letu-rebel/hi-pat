## Chapel Speaker Presentation

### Introduction

- Speaker is Dr. Mark Cortez, professor at Wheaton College 
- He teaches theology and specializes in theological anthropology and Christology
- Will be giving a lecture tonight on "What Does it Mean to Think of Jesus as the True Human?"

### Scripture Focus - Numbers 22

- Tells the story of Balak and Balaam 
- Israel has left Egypt, wandered 40 years, and is approaching Moab where Balak is king
- Balak fears Israel so sends for Balaam to curse them
- Balaam asks God who first says not to go, then says to go
- An angel blocks Balaam's path until he gets the message
- Balaam ends up blessing Israel multiple times instead of cursing

### Two Interesting Things About the Story

#### God's Actions

- God first tells Balaam not to go, then says to go, then blocks his way  
- This highlights God's emphasis on getting the message right
- The message is that Israel is blessed because they belong to God
- God is faithful and will not revoke His blessing
- Important for Israel to remember this truth amidst uncertainty

#### The Donkey

- Donkey could see angel but Balaam could not at first
- Shows God uses unexpected voices to convey messages
- We should listen for God speaking through unexpected means

### Application 

- We can fail to remember the blessing of belonging to God amidst busyness
- Asked students to imagine the class least likely for God to speak to them
- Challenge to listen for God's voice there, recognizing He can use anything

### Closing Thoughts

- Compared professors to Balaam's donkey as unexpected voices
- Closed in prayer thanking God for being awesome, the blessing of belonging to Him, and His faithfulness
