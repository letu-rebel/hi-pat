## Chapel Speaker Presentation Summary

The speaker was **James Doherty**, a Letourneau University alumnus from 2001. He currently serves as president of OMF, a mission organization. 

**Background**

- Doherty grew up as a pastor's son in California. At age 14, his family briefly moved to Indonesia which had a significant spiritual impact on him. 

- He studied avionics and got his A&P license at Letourneau. He was involved in student government and campus ministry. 

- Since 2006, Doherty has served in ministry and missions in Asia. Last year, he became president of OMF in the U.S.

**Talk Overview**

- Doherty shared how God worked in his life, especially during his time at Letourneau. 

- He reflected on Jesus' statement in John 4:34 about doing God's will and finishing His work. This gave perspective on our role in God's greater plan.

- Joseph's life was examined as an example of how God uses difficulties and disappointments to grow and prepare people for greater things. 

**Key Points**

- Doherty lacked confidence about ministry and wanted to avoid working with people early on. God grew him past those limitations.

- Though painful, disappointments and hardships can develop godly character if we persevere in obedience. 

- Like Joseph, we should see ourselves as part of God's larger plan and purpose despite disappointments. 

- God patiently works on the areas we need to grow and then expands our opportunities for ministry.

- The questions remain for us: Are we willing to see where God wants us to grow? To move past disappointments? To open our eyes and see God at work?
