### Chapel Speaker Presentation

Dr. Ben Johnson, Old Testament professor at LeTourneau, shared about his family's experience with a high-risk pregnancy and the importance of the shared Christian life. 

- Johnsons found out last fall they were expecting a 4th child. Mid-semester, his wife's water broke at only 21 weeks - too early for the baby to be viable. They went to the hospital expecting a miscarriage. 

- A nurse gave them hope, saying "we're not giving up yet." Doctors could only put his wife on bedrest until 23 weeks, when there was a chance the baby could survive. Johnson became a single parent and professor. 

- Their church and community surrounded them in prayer for the baby's survival. At 23 weeks, miraculously the waters resealed and pregnancy continued normally. But days later waters broke again, requiring extended hospitalization.

- In the hospital, his wife could only eat limited foods due to celiac disease. Community brought meals, his kids' school provided lunches. His colleagues covered classes so he could teach. Their trauma was shared.

- Each week in the hospital was crucial for the baby's development. Johnson depended completely on God and fervent prayer. Church continued praying. They made it to 34 weeks. 

- Baby Asher was born and only needed 8 days in the NICU before coming home with his mother. Doctors called it a miracle, but Johnson said the miracle was being upheld by the prayers and support of their Christian community. 

- Johnson learned dependence on God and others. He couldn't have managed alone. This exemplified the Christian shared life described in Acts 2. Not everyone with this trauma has the same outcome or support system. 

- The Johnson's story illustrates the importance of living in Biblical community, bearing each other's burdens, and the power of prayer. Our shared life as believers is a miracle and gift.
