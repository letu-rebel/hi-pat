# Chapel Speaker Presentation Summary

The speaker, Dr. Derek Sherman, explored how Psalm 8 relates to technology and engineering from a Christian perspective. 

## Main Points

- Psalm 8 praises God as creator and ruler of the heavens and earth. It highlights God's majesty and glory.
- The Psalm considers humanity's place in creation. We are small yet cared for by God, and called to rule over creation responsibly.
- All of creation, including its technological possibilities, belongs to God. Agriculture and technology are part of what God intended in creation.
- As God's image-bearers, part of our role is to unfold the possibilities of creation through areas like technology and engineering. 
- The Bible shows how technology can help steward creation, like the ark saving Noah's family. But sin has also perverted technology for harm, like the prideful Tower of Babel.
- Jesus succeeds where humanity fails, and through him all things are redeemed including technology.
- Engineers can serve God through sustainable and just technologies that care for creation and neighbors. We can make technology beautiful and useful.
- The Psalm's vision calls us to responsibly develop technology as part of God's kingdom work. All vocations matter to God.

## Conclusion

- Though not mentioned explicitly, technology is part of the potential in God's good creation.
- Despite sin's effects, we are called to obediently unfold technological possibilities as part of our role given by God.
- The Psalm invites reflection on how God is revealed in creation's possibilities, and how we can exercise responsibility over technology.
