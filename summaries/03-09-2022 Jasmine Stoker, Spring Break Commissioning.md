# The God Who Finishes What He Starts

## Introduction
- Speaker shares about working at a bakery making croissants, which involves a tedious, repetitive process of folding, rolling, and freezing the dough to create the layers. 
- This process reminds her of the story of Jesus at the well, which has a repetitive pattern from other "well" stories in the Bible.

## The Pattern at the Well
- There is a pattern in several Bible stories of a journey, a woman at a well, a request for water, news brought back, hospitality, and a joining of parties.
- The well seems to be a place of proposal and engagement. 

## Waiting on God's Promise
- Through the Bible, God's people had to wait and remember God's pattern and promises to fully unite with Him. 

## Jesus Chose to Rest at the Well
- Jesus was weary, but could have rested anywhere. He chose to rest at the well because that's where he wanted to be.
- God rests not because He is tired, but because there is no better place to be than with His people.

## The Gospel is Intentional
- Jesus meeting the Samaritan woman was not an afterthought - it was part of God's intentional plan.
- God knew the cost of creating humanity, but chose to create and pursue us anyway because we are wanted and loved.

## Jesus Revealed Himself to the Woman
- An outcast culturally and religiously, yet Jesus revealed himself as Messiah to her first. 
- This shows God can use anyone to accomplish His plans.

## It's Not About Us, It's About God
- We shouldn't boast in our own abilities, but recognize that God works through us by His Spirit. 
- The people believed because of God's work in their hearts, not because of the woman's testimony.

## God Wants Us to Join His Work  
- Jesus calls the disciples to open their eyes, for the fields are ready for harvest. 
- God has prepared the way and now wants us to participate in the work He is doing.

## Conclusion
- As we go on mission, we must remember it's not about us, but surrendering to be used by God. 
- There are many waiting to hear the gospel, and God wants us to join Him in His work.
