## Dr. Sedgel's Presentation

- Dr. Sedgel shares his personal story of growing up in a troubled environment where he questioned God's existence. He attended a Christian college but still did not have a relationship with Christ. 

- He explains how creation points to a Creator, but he was unsure if it was the God of the Bible. At college, he misused his newfound freedom and struggled academically at first.

- He shares how a friend named Frank helped lead him to Christ through meeting regularly and discussing faith questions. On a drive home, Dr. Sedgel realized he needed to figure out his relationship with Christ.

- After listening to a convicting sermon from Frank online, Dr. Sedgel got on his knees and prayed, accepting Christ as his savior. He explains how God provides despite hardships when we know him. 

- Dr. Sedgel challenges students to shine their light and live fully alive in Christ, impacting those around them. He encourages getting involved in a local church and building an authentic faith.

- He concludes by asking if students truly know God, expressing hope that they would come to salvation in Christ if they do not already know him.
