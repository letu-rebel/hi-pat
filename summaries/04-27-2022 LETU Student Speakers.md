## Speaker Presentation Summary

### Bailey Fry - The God Who is Awesome

- God is holy, righteous, majestic, kind, gracious, and merciful. 

- Do we act in awe of God? Do we tremble at His holiness, rejoice in His righteousness, worship His beauty, cry at His graciousness?

- God is more beautiful than any creation. He is worthy of our awe. 

- The supreme example of God's splendor is when He, high and lifted up, was crucified. He humbled Himself to be ridiculed, beaten, and crucified. He was mocked while dying for our sins. 

- We still scorn and mock Jesus, neglecting Him for other things. We make idols of other things that grab our attention more than God.

- We must be thankful for what God has done and be mindful of His graciousness. We need God's help to stir our affections back to Him.

- Jesus' sacrifice is enough for our sins. Who are we to reject His grace when He knows our sins yet still loves us? 

- The Holy Spirit works in us to turn our hearts back to loving and being in awe of God.

### Ben Wisser - The God Who is Faithful Despite Our Disappointment  

- It's natural and human to be disappointed with God sometimes. Voicing disappointment shows intimacy in the relationship. 

- Many biblical characters lamented disappointment with God, like Abraham, Elijah, and John the Baptist.

- Check expectations against God's promises. Misaligned expectations lead to disappointment.

- Contentment comes through God alone, not God plus our desires. 

- Jeremiah voiced disappointment to God about the prosperity of the wicked. God redirected his focus back to His promises.

- Jeremiah later praised God's steadfast love and faithfulness despite intense tragedy and disappointment. 

- Keep perspective - disappointment is seasonal. Trust God will pull you through. Listen for what God's revealing in disappointment.

- Jesus understands disappointment more than anyone. Lift your doubts and fears to Him. Hope in His steadfast love and mercy.

### Haniya McCurty - The God Who Acknowledges Us

- Two stories in Mark 5: Jairus asked Jesus to heal his daughter, and a woman reached to touch Jesus' cloak to be healed.

- Both used their desperation to acknowledge their need for Jesus rather than despair. 

- Acknowledging Jesus requires making a move - stepping out in faith, taking risks, being willing to do whatever it takes.

- When Jairus and the woman acknowledged Jesus, He acknowledged them in return.

- Jesus looked to the woman and called her "daughter", giving her an identity and relationship. 

- We have a caring Father in Jesus. He will provide, protect, and love us.

- Don't acknowledge fear, doubt, worry - only acknowledge Jesus. Hold to His promises. 

- Jesus carried our pain and dirt to give us the invitation to join God's family. Acknowledge Him.
