# Speaker Presentation Summary

## Introduction
- Terry Zetlow, Vice President for Development, introduced the guest speaker, Will Dinkins. 

- Will Dinkins is a 1958 graduate of Letourneau who knew RG and Evelyn Letourneau personally. He later became the Alumni Director and Missions Director at Letourneau.

## Will's Testimony
- Will accepted Christ at age 15 during a church revival in 1951. He got involved with Youth for Christ and eventually felt called to attend Columbia Bible College. 

- At Columbia Bible College, Will met his future wife Joan. They married after graduating. 

- Will's grandmother gave him a copy of RG Letourneau's publication "Now." This inspired Will to attend Letourneau College to become an engineer while serving God.

## Experiences with the Letourneaus
- Will flew with RG Letourneau on weekends as he spoke across the country. Evelyn Letourneau encouraged Will in this role. 

- RG's speeches focused on sharing his testimony of God's work and provision in his life and business after committing to give more. His life verse was Matthew 6:33.

- RG was down-to-earth and had sayings like "the difficult we do immediately, the impossible just takes a little longer."

- On a flight alone with just RG, he told Will that preachers preach but laymen living for God makes people listen. This became Will's mandate.

## Working at Ford Motor Company
- Will left Letourneau after graduating and worked as an engineer at Ford Motor Company. 

- Will and other Letourneau graduates stood out for their work ethic, maturity, and positive attitudes. Their Christian commitment shone through.

- Hard work led to promotions for Will over less diligent but likely brilliant coworkers. Will attributes his work ethic to his experiences at Letourneau.

## Closing Thoughts
- Will closed by encouraging students to lay aside sin, fix eyes on Jesus, and seek God's kingdom first like RG Letourneau exemplified.
