### Sermon Title: "Jesus the One and Only" 

### Scripture: John 1:1-5

### Main Points

- Jesus is unique and exclusive
  - No one like Him has ever existed before or will after
  - He is the only way to the Father

- Jesus' Identity
  - He is eternally God
  - He is equally God with the Father and Spirit
  - He is essentially God in His nature

- Jesus' Activity 
  - He created all things
  - He sustains all things

- Jesus' Intentionality
  - He came to bring light to the darkness
  - He came to bring life to the dead

### Application 

- If we believe Jesus is the one and only:
  - We will praise Him
  - He will have preeminence in our lives
  - We will proclaim Him to others

- We must not just know facts about Jesus, but have a heart knowledge of Him

- We must make Jesus preeminent above all in our lives

- We must point people to Jesus, the only one who can give life and light

### Conclusion

- There has never been and never will be anyone like Jesus
- He alone is the one and only Savior
- We must praise, exalt, and proclaim Him
