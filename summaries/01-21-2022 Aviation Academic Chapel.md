### Speaker Presentation Summary

Ms. Heidi DeCoster, a 1994 graduate of LeTourneau University, currently flies as a captain for Alaska Airlines on the Boeing 737. 

After graduating, Ms. DeCoster worked various aviation jobs including flight instructing in Texas, flying Beechcraft 1900s for Great Lakes Aviation, and flying the DC-9 and 737 for US Airways. She was furloughed after 9/11 and flew the Dornier for PSA Airlines before being hired by Alaska Airlines in 2003 where she has worked for the past 18 years.

Ms. DeCoster shared how her education at LeTourneau prepared her to be a professional pilot - teaching her to be on time, presentable, and prepared. The integrity and teamwork emphasized at LeTourneau have served her throughout her career. She encouraged students not to give up pursuing aviation even when it is difficult. 

Ms. DeCoster discussed some of the challenges faced as a female pilot including ill-fitting uniforms, proving herself, and balancing family and career. She emphasized bringing professionalism in communication and attitude. Overall, she encouraged seeing everyone as a pilot rather than identifying as a female or male pilot.

In terms of rewarding aspects of the job, Ms. DeCoster highlighted the teamwork involved in solving problems and overcoming challenges to safely transport passengers. She sees opportunities to be the hands and feet of Jesus by helping passengers in need.

Ms. DeCoster encouraged students to take advantage of networking opportunities and apply for internships. She emphasized the importance of living in base when working for an airline. Her advice for students was to have a good attitude, be prepared, and not give up on an aviation career.
