### Speaker Presentation Summary

Dr. Dina Shelton spoke about "The God Who Sees Me" based on the biblical story of Hagar from Genesis. 

- She shared about her background in psychology and counseling and how relationships teach us about being seen and known. 

- Discussed how mirror neurons and attachment cycles wire us for connection from birth. Early relationships with parents shape our mental maps of whether people are safe and trustworthy.

- When early relationships are broken through abuse, neglect, etc it changes those maps and how we see the world. Can lead to outcomes like fragmented identity, lack of emotional regulation, seeking approval, withdrawal, boundary issues, perfectionism, apathy, lack of belonging.

- These are coping mechanisms for lack of early stability and safety. Counseling helps unravel and heal these hurts through healthy new relationships.

- Told Hagar's story - a slave who was exploited, got angry, was mistreated by Sarah, and ran away alone and unseen. But God saw her and sent an angel telling her to return, though her life would still be hard. 

- Hagar found the God who sees her. She didn't need an easy life, just to be seen and known as she truly was.

- We can all be seen and found by God, and be part of others' healing through healthy relationships. Our interactions with others are incredibly influential.

- Encouraged students to embrace being conduits of God's love and healing in all their relationships. Relationships are a skill we can get better at.
