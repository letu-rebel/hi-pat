## Chapel Speaker Presentation

- The speaker opens by joking about how Dr. Mays wants to be the chaplain and fly down to preach, asking the audience to tell Dr. Mays they already did that when he asks how chapel went.

- The speaker introduces the Bible passage Matthew 25:31-46 about the separation of the sheep and the goats and caring for "the least of these." 

- There are two types of well-laid plans - ones that thankfully don't work out, and ones God uses beyond our imagination. 

- The speaker shares a story of a foolish plan he had as a kid to make a fake pipe bomb and put it in his teacher's mailbox, which thankfully his dad prevented. 

- In contrast, he shares how his youth group made plans to care for those with disabilities after ignoring a student with Down syndrome. This taught them to be comfortable with the uncomfortable in ministering to the marginalized.

- The passage calls us not to be comfortable but to reach out to the hurting world. The "least of these" are our brothers and sisters, including those in this room. 

- College is a time to learn these lessons and take them into our communities. We must lean into discomfort and see the face of Jesus in those who are hungry, hurting, or ostracized. 

- The speaker closes by praying for boldness to be uncomfortable in serving others, whether that's with friends, classmates, or in the community. He prays we would see Jesus and serve to glorify God's name.
