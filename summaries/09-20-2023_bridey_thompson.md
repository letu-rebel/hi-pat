## Speaker's Message

### Why Christians Must Take a Stand

- Abortion is by definition killing an innocent human being
    - Scientifically, the unborn are biologically human and alive from fertilization
- The Bible is clear on the value of human beings
    - Made in God's image from the moment of creation
    - Bear God's image regardless of age or ability 
    - Jesus himself came as a human embryo
- If the unborn are persons, all arguments for abortion fail 
    - We would never argue a mother in poverty could kill her toddler
- Scripture calls us to action through justice and love

### What Taking a Stand Looks Like

- Begins with conviction - rejecting ideas that some humans have more value
- Commit to building a culture of life that starts with Christ
- Live out in everyday life - conversations, family planning, supporting parents
- Be a loving activist - volunteer, educate, get involved on campus
- Come to the Pro-Life Club meeting to learn more!

### Closing Thoughts

- Abortion is never right or loving
- Every person deserves love and compassion as an image bearer 
- Let's build the culture of life Jesus brought
- Go out and be blessed and be a blessing
