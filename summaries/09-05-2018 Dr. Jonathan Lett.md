# Speaker's Presentation

The speaker, Dr. Lett, focused his talk on the costs of technology and how it can impact our ability to achieve the purpose for which we are created - fellowship with God and others. 

## Dispelling the Myth of Neutral Technology

- Technology is not neutral because it has unintended consequences and always reflects the goals of its creators through its design. It makes certain actions easier and others harder.

## Tech Creators Use Psychology to Hack Our Brains

- Tech companies hire psychologists and neuroscientists to make devices as addictive and persuasive as possible through invisible techniques. 

- Goals are to exploit human vulnerabilities to get attention and hook users in order to monetize that attention.

- Many tech creators have expressed regret over exploiting human psychology in this way.

## Attention is Central to Human Relationships and Rest 

- Attention is vital for meaningful relationships, self-awareness, relationship with God, and rest. 

- Studies show technology often decreases happiness, rest, information retention, and discernment.

- Lack of rest negatively impacts ability to process information, increases anxiety/depression, hurts health, and impairs judgement.

## We Need a Plan to Manage Technology

- The Christian life requires focused attention for transformative practices like prayer, worship, study. 

- We must be intentional about managing technology so it doesn't manage us.

- As a community we can think about healthy tech management. As individuals we need a personal plan.

- Be encouraged that Christ has given us true rest and the Holy Spirit empowers our attention.
