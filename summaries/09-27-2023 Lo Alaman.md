## Speaker Introduction
- Lo Alleman is a traveling poet, artist, rapper, and speaker
- This is his third time speaking at the university's chapel 
- He loves coming to speak at the school because of the students' hunger for Jesus 

## Poem Performance
- Performed a vulnerable, reflective poem about "guilty pleasures"
- Discussed tendencies to justify small sins or compromises as "not a big deal"
- Challenged the notion of "guilty pleasures" by showing how they can lead to larger issues
- Argued true pleasure and joy comes from freedom in Christ, not entertaining things that grieve God

## The Gospel as a "Loaded Portrait"
- People often form caricatures of others before meeting them, exaggerating certain features
- Similarly, we can overemphasize certain parts of the gospel portrait 
- Focusing only on Jesus as social reformer, rule follower, etc misses full picture
- Must not load the gospel portrait with our assumptions or desired emphases

## The Power of the Gospel
- Gospel is referred to in Scripture as carrying power, like dynamite
- Aims for heart change more than outward reformation or behavior modification
- Transforms individuals and communities through the Spirit's work

## The Gospel Story 
- God made humans for relationship with Him, but we were unfaithful 
- Because God is faithful, He sent Jesus to live, die, and rise again
- Purpose was to restore us to relationship with God forever
- This framework is consistent throughout Scripture's narratives

## Living by the Gospel
- We tend to form caricatures and overemphasize certain aspects
- But gospel is invitation to relationship as adopted sons/daughters
- Our identity is in being loved by God, not in good works or performance
- Holiness is about closeness with God, not perfection or rule-following

## Prayer for Communion 
- Invited students to open arms, breathe, and pray for the Spirit to fill them
- Emphasized being made for communion/relationship rather than works
- Asked for faulty gospels/metrics to be challenged and full picture of Christ seen
- Prayed for campus revival and personal encounters with God's love
