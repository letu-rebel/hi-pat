## Worship Summary

- The chapel event opened with prayer, asking God to be with the attendees and guide the time. 

- Songs of worship were sung, with lyrics about praising God, God's greatness, grace, and glory. The overall sentiment during worship was one of joy, gratitude, and celebration of who God is.

- There was a time of communal prayer, with attendees praying aloud together. Prayers expressed thankfulness for what God has done through Jesus Christ, asked for God's work in their lives, and surrendered themselves to God's will. 

- The pastor closed worship in prayer, thanking God for Jesus' sacrifice on the cross which makes new life available, and asking God to do a new work in each person through the power of Christ.


## Presentation Summary

The chapel speaker, Dean of Students Dr. Steve Echols, gave a comedic monologue in the style of a late night talk show host. 

### Topics Covered:

- Letourneau's improved rankings in US News & World Report. Letourneau is ranked high for having the most valedictorians per capita in Texas, likely due to having many homeschooled students. 

- Letourneau's strategic plan and capital fundraising campaign led by President Mason. The campaign's goal is to raise funds for hair transplants for the president, campus pastor, VP of development, a faculty representative, and the athletic director. This was presented jokingly.

- Recent athletic accomplishments at Letourneau, including the men's soccer team being runner-up in their league, the volleyball team making the playoffs, and the men's basketball team winning a championship in 2020. However, some students feel there is a divide between athletes and non-athletes on campus. An athlete said no matter how hard they try or how much they win, the other students are "division one nerds" while they are "division three athletes." Again, this was presented in a joking manner.

- Upcoming chapel event next week featuring the Kendrick brothers' new documentary "Show Me the Father." Students will receive spiritual formation credit for attending.

The speaker then had an extended interview-style conversation with the RD of South Hall, where they discussed their college experiences and how God brought restoration into their lives during difficult times. Themes included dealing with feelings of inadequacy, shame, failure, and wrestling with identity. They emphasized it was a journey involving mentors, counseling, accountability, and learning to seek God rather than just following rules or expectations.
