## Speaker Presentation Summary

Michelle Gennaro, a missionary with Africa Inland Mission, shared her testimony and message for Go Week.

- Michelle initially did not want to be a missionary but God called her and her husband Chris to serve in Uganda. They obeyed God's call and were appointed as AIM missionaries in 2008.

- They sold everything they owned and moved their family of 8 to Lesotho, Africa in 2011. God used Chris' sewing skills to bless the people there. 

- In January 2013, Chris became very ill and went into a coma. He passed away on February 16, 2013. 

- Michelle cried out to God during this time. She asked God to prepare her for whatever testimony he had for her through this suffering.

- Michelle shared how God has carried her through the grief and equipped her in the past 5 years since Chris' death. God has been faithful and she proclaims his goodness.

- Michelle encouraged the students that their response when their world is turned upside down is what will bring glory to God. Suffering and persecution often leads to revival.

- She challenged them to listen to what God is speaking to them during Go Week. He may not be calling them to do something big, but to respond rightly when trials come.

- Michelle testified that God is working behind the scenes in their lives now to prepare them for what he will use to turn their world upside down for Jesus.
