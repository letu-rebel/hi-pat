## Speaker Presentation Summary

The speaker was Pastor Eric Love from Church on Purpose in Longview, TX. His sermon was titled "You Are Stronger Than You Think" based on 1 Corinthians 10:13.

### Main Points:

- Temptation is a natural and normal part of life. We will all face temptations. 

- There are two sources of temptation - Satan and our own sinful flesh. 

- Being tempted is not a sin, but how we respond to temptation can lead to sin.

- Temptation will always be present, no matter where you go or what you do. 

- God promises that no temptation will come upon you that you cannot bear. The temptation will never be greater than your ability to resist it.

- With every temptation, God provides a way of escape. There is always a door or opportunity to leave the temptation. 

- Your responsibility when tempted is to look for the way of escape that God provides. 

- Guidelines for avoiding temptation:

  1. Live the right way - God's way. Make choices aligned with God's will.

  2. Put on the Lord Jesus Christ - Put on His righteousness, think what Jesus would do.

  3. Make no provision for the flesh - Don't go where you'll be tempted or associate with those who lead you into sin.

- If you listen closely when tempted, you'll hear God's voice telling you not to give in. 

- Overall encouragement that with God's help, we can resist any temptation that comes our way.
