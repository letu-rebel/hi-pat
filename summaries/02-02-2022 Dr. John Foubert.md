# Summary of Chapel Speaker's Presentation

## Introduction

- Speaker is Dr. John Fobert, dean at Union University and expert on sexual assault prevention for the U.S. Army
- He has studied the effects of pornography for 15 years and written books on the topic
- Goal is to share information on how pornography harms, not condemn it from a biblical standpoint
- Will use descriptive language but not explicit terms

## Pornography's Impact

- First interviewee shared story of exposure to porn at age 5 leading to sexual abuse by siblings
- Studies show 64% of Christian men and 15% of women use porn at least monthly  
- Among young adults, 80% of men and 42% of women use porn monthly
- Pornography activates the "object" part of the brain, not "people" area

## Pornography Industry

- $13.3 billion annual revenue, more than NFL, NBA, MLB combined  
- Motivated by profit, actively trying to reach new markets like women
- Violence in porn has increased from rare in 1980s to common today
- Over 100 studies link porn to violent behavior, 50 link it to sexual violence

## Role of Christian Community

- Christian colleges and churches can fight porn's harms through fellowship and accountability
- Need to engage in spiritual battle against exploitation, regardless of personal use
- Christian love is a powerful weapon against sin

## Steps Forward

- Flee from temptation, confess sins, be in community
- Accountability software, avoiding smart phones can help users
- Come to evening sessions to learn more about porn's harms
