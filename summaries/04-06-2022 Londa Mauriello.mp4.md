- The speaker will be looking at the story of Abraham and Isaac in Genesis 22, where Abraham calls the name of the place where God provided a ram as a substitute sacrifice "Jehovah Jireh".

- The speaker will discuss how God's provision goes beyond just giving us things, but rather God sees our needs and sees to it that they are met.

## Speaker's Presentation

### Introduction

- This semester's chapel theme has been "God Who" - each week exploring an aspect of who God is and what he does. 

### God as Jehovah Jireh (God Who Provides)

- God is first identified as Jehovah Jireh (God who provides) in Genesis 22 when Abraham names the place where God provided a ram "Jehovah Jireh". 

- Jehovah Jireh comes from the Hebrew word "raah" meaning "to see, to foresee". God's foresight leads to his provision.

- God's provision is more than just giving us things - it's God seeing our needs and ensuring they are met.

### Genesis 22 Review 

- God commands Abraham to sacrifice Isaac, his promised son. Abraham obeys and prepares to sacrifice Isaac. 

- Isaac asks where the lamb is for the burnt offering. Abraham says God will provide the lamb.

- God stops Abraham and provides a ram in the thicket for the sacrifice instead of Isaac. 

- Abraham names the place "Jehovah Jireh", meaning "The Lord Will Provide".

### Application from Genesis 22

- We can follow Abraham and Isaac's example of obedience and submission to experience God's provision. 

- God gives commands that don't always make human sense, but we must obey. Isaac submitted even to being bound on the altar.

- When we obey and submit to God's commands, God provides - just as he provided the ram for Abraham.

### God's Ultimate Provision

- Just as the ram was a substitute for Isaac, Jesus is the ultimate substitute sacrifice provided by God for all people. 

- Jesus is the "Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world" (John 1:29). 

- On the cross, Jesus was the final sacrifice for sins, likely in the same region as Abraham's sacrifice.

- While there was no substitute for Isaac, God provided Jesus as the substitute for our sins so we can be made right with God.
