## Chapel Speaker Presentation Summary

Tracy Catron, director of the Center for Global Service Learning, welcomed students to chapel and explained her office's role in connecting faculty and students with global service learning opportunities. 

She shared an ancient story from 2 Kings about four lepers living on the margins of the besieged city of Samaria. Facing starvation inside the city, the lepers decide to walk into the enemy camp, hoping they will be given food or killed swiftly. When they arrive, the enemy camp is deserted. After eating, one leper realizes they should share this news with the starving city. The city is saved when the lepers report the enemy has fled. 

Catron said this story captures the heart of global service learning - using what we've received in abundance to bless and help those experiencing scarcity and marginalization. She suggested Letourneau's blessing is the education and skills training students receive. The goal is to leverage Letourneau's expertise to help solve problems stemming from poverty and injustice.

Students shared video highlights from global service learning projects this year:
- The Wheels Project provides wheelchairs in developing countries
- Engineered Water Solutions works on irrigation in Senegal
- Nursing Counseling Project provides health education in Belize

Dr. Steven Ayers and student Sam Hodges discussed the Engineered Water Solutions irrigation project in Senegal:
- Started to apply Ayers' engineering skills to serve others in need
- Chose irrigation over drinking water so as not to risk lives if a system failed
- Use local materials and labor for sustainability and to build local capacity
- Relationships with local partners are critical for long-term success

Hodges highlighted global service learning allows students to apply classroom learning to help others in tangible ways.
