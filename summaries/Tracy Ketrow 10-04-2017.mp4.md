### Story of the Lepers

- Catron told an ancient story from 2 Kings about four lepers living on the margins of the besieged city of Samaria. Facing starvation inside the city walls, the lepers decide to walk into the enemy camp, expecting to either be killed quickly or given food and sent away. But when they arrive, the enemy camp is deserted. The lepers eat, gather provisions, and one leper convinces the others to share the good news with the starving city. This story captures the essence of global service learning - using blessings received to help those in need.
