## Speaker Presentation Summary

The speaker, Shep, shared his life story and testimony of how his difficult upbringing and unhealthy mindsets were transformed when he encountered the love of God through a college student. 

Shep grew up in extreme poverty in Florida with 15 siblings and a single mother working multiple jobs. His father was in prison for murder. He had no positive male influences and got involved with a gang, spiraling into violence and reckless behavior. 

At age 10, Shep was sexually abused by a Sunday school teacher, leaving him disillusioned with God. He hated all men and authority figures. By 14, he decided to commit suicide, feeling hopeless. But he had an encounter with Jesus that changed his mindset and life direction. 

Shep then had an opportunity to attend a Christian athletic camp led by college football player Shawn Alexander. This was the first time he experienced love from a man. Shawn made a commitment to invest in Shep's life long-term. 

Shep ended up becoming the first male in his family to graduate high school. He earned a football scholarship and became the first to attend and graduate college. He is now a public speaker sharing his story around the world. 

His message emphasized making the choice to go against negative cultural tides. He challenged students to pursue being the best version of themselves through God's empowerment. Shep credits his transformation to the investment of a college student.

The core emphasis was opening one's eyes to see themselves and the world as God sees it. This opens the door for God to work powerfully and use someone to make a difference.
