## Summary of Chapel Speaker's Presentation

The speaker, Josh Reyes, is a 2019 graduate of Letourneau University. He currently works as a collegiate strength and conditioning coach. 

### Introduction
- Josh thanks the university for the opportunity to speak and making him feel welcome and secure in Christ.
- He shares about his background - graduating with a degree in Kinesiology, and now working as a strength coach for a college baseball team.

### The Allure of Control
- Josh talks about the desire for control that strength coaches have - extensive planning, data collection, etc. 
- But there is always an element of chaos and unpredictability in athletics.
- He shares a real injury report from his team showing many muscle strains and injuries. 
- As the "muscle guy", he often gets blamed when injuries happen.
- This shows the illusion of control, and how chaos often breaks in.

### Losing Sight of Christ
- Josh transparently shares that it's easy to lose sight of magnifying Christ in the busyness of work. 
- He focuses on secondary matters instead of keeping Christ first.

### Magnifying Christ 
- Quotes John Piper's definition of magnifying - making Christ look more like He really is.
- We shouldn't try to make Christ bigger, but see Him accurately. 

### The Problem in Colossae
- The Colossians had a distorted, diluted view of Christ. 
- They were tempted to think too small of Christ and too big of themselves.

### Solution - Look Through the Telescope
- Colossians 1:15-20 provides a telescope view of Christ's supremacy.
- It gives concentrated descriptions of Christ's glory from beginning to end.

### Christ Holds All Things Together
- Key point - Christ's supremacy means we can have peace despite lack of control and surrounding chaos.
- Christ actively holds all of creation together by His word.
- All matter would collapse without Christ upholding it.
- Everything is working towards Christ - our lives, salvation, education, etc.

### Application 
- We must make Christ first in all areas of life - motives, morality, relationships, work, resources, conversations, politics, social media, etc.
- Examine if we fail to make Christ first because we have too small a view of Him.
- Pray for a right view of Christ's supremacy and preeminence.
