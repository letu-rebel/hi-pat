# Chapel Speaker Presentation

## Introduction
- Speaker is Ed Rufus, former missionary and art teacher
- He will give a pottery wheel throwing demonstration while sharing about his life and connecting it to biblical truths 

## Wheel Throwing Demonstration
- Reads Jeremiah 18:1-6 about the potter and the clay to set up the metaphor
- Explains the tools he will use - wire, sponge, metal rib, pin tool, wooden tool
- Shares how God is hands-on like a potter shaping clay

## Life Experiences and Lessons
- As a child, learned to obey parents through dangerous situation
- Learned not to steal when caught taking an apple
- Accepted Jesus into his life at age 6 through his Godly parents
- Lost his father and friend in a car accident at age 13
  - Turned to God more through the tragedy
- Realized God had a purpose through the rough times
- Found hope in God's faithfulness and realized he wasn't the victim of a cruel joke

## Tragedy and God's Sovereignty 
- Tragedy takes many forms - broken relationships, betrayal, sickness, etc.
- Satan wants to destroy lives, but Jesus brings fullness of life
- Tools can seem scary from clay's perspective, but Potter knows the purpose
- Isaiah 64:8 - We are the clay, God is the Potter
- God's promises never fail, Jesus is who He says He is

## Call to Action
- Jesus wants to shape lives into beautiful vessels
- Some may realize they need Jesus, some have experienced tragedy and need to surrender to God, some need encouragement to let God keep shaping them

## Closing Prayer
- Thanked God for the chance to share His faithfulness and goodness
- Prayed for those who don't know Jesus, have experienced tragedy, and who are being shaped by God
- Asked God to touch every part of lives
