# Speaker Presentation Summary

The speaker, Dr. Brad Kallenberg, reflected on Deuteronomy 4:9 about not forgetting what God has done and teaching it to the next generations. This passage was central to the early church. 

He discussed how the ancient Christian liturgy developed by John Chrysostom repeats the call to "attend to thyself", implying it is important but difficult to do well. 

The speaker shared his story of growing up in a very religious home with rules against smoking and movies. He thought religion was about checking boxes and conforming. 

In high school, his girlfriend broke up with him for not demonstrating leadership. He blamed God instead of taking responsibility. 

He started hanging out with joyful Christian friends in college. He imitated them, becoming more confident, but still misunderstood "attend to thyself." He was focused on spiritual activities, not alignment with Christ.

He realized he was self-deceived like the Pharisee, who was righteous but not aligned with God's path. The tax collector's prayer showed humility and need for mercy. 

The speaker confessed his tendency to avoid attending to himself because it's difficult and he doesn't like what he sees. But this attention should be "paid" like money, not "consumed." Social media consumes attention instead.

He concluded that attending to oneself is important because our hearts are bigger than we realize. Like Augustine, God calls us to look inward, though it's difficult, to find Him and realign with Christ. Regular self-examination is needed.
