# Summary of Chapel Speaker's Presentation

The speaker begins by thanking everyone for participating in the difficult conversations about technology this week during the Spiritual Emphasis chapel services. He acknowledges these topics are challenging but necessary for growth. 

## Main Points

### Jesus is Lord of Technology

- Jesus is Lord and King over everything, including technology. 
- We need to truly hand over our technology to His Lordship rather than just surrendering parts of our lives.  
- If this week's talks have bothered us, it may be because we have too small a view of Jesus or too big a view of our technology.

### Claims About Technology Require Christian Discernment  

- We should not just accept claims that technology "just is" or that we have to "deal with it." As Christians, we know where history is ultimately headed - to Christ's return and kingdom.

- Likewise, claims that technology will "save us" should be viewed with skepticism. Only Christ's power can save us.

- The notion that technology is an "extension of ourselves" gives it too much of a free pass. Our tech still needs to come under the Lordship of Christ.

## Practices for Walking in the Light of the Lord

1. Tell the Truth
   - We need to be brutally honest about how much we use technology and what we use it for. 
   - We are poor judges of our own tech use.
   - Truth telling requires community and listening to others.

2. Rest  
   - We need space away from technology to pray, worship, and contemplate. 
   - Tech Sabbaths are one way to practice rest.

3. Consecration
   - Daily consecrating our technology to be used for God's purposes.
   - Reminding ourselves that our devices belong to God, not to us.

The speaker closes by inviting the audience to consecrate their phones to the Lordship of Christ.
