### Worship

- Opening prayer asking God to guide the students in considering spring break mission trips and being sensitive to God's leading in choosing where to serve. Praying that the Holy Spirit would stir hearts to follow God's calling.

- Song: "Just One Touch" focusing on God's power and presence through just one touch or word from Him. 

- Song: "Lay Me Down" surrendering fully to God's will and way. Asking God for mercy and acknowledging nothing in life is far from Him.

- Prayer thanking God for missions and the blessing of serving others. Asking God to work through and prepare the hearts of the students going on mission trips to share the gospel and meet practical needs. Praying for life change through the trips. 

- Scripture reading from 1 Peter 4 about using gifts to serve others and point them to Christ so God is glorified. Centering focus on God's Word and the calling to spread the faith.

- Overall spirit of gratitude for the chance to go serve others and share faith. Recognizing the trips are ultimately about living out and preaching the gospel, not just having fun adventures. Desire to follow where God leads even if uncomfortable or inconvenient.  


## Summary of Chapel Speaker's Presentation

- The speaker, Michael deGroat, is an alum who graduated in 2008 with a degree in international business. He went on a mission trip to Amsterdam while a student. 

- He encourages students to take advantage of mission trip opportunities like the upcoming spring break trips, continuing Letourneau's legacy of service.

- Ministry is using your God-given gifts to do the work God called you to, blessing those around you through the Holy Spirit within. All majors can participate.

- Spiritual growth happens through "oxano" - a Greek word meaning "to cause to grow." How can we help cause growth in others?

- Growth happens at unexpected times, rarely on schedule. It's usually inconvenient, as time doesn't pause. It often doesn't feel significant in the moment.

- Live ready to do ministry. Be present, listen, and point people to Christ. Let the Holy Spirit speak through you.

- Growth happens in community through shared life. The college years offer unique chances for deep community. Listen to and love others. 

- Moving from our comfort zone to growth zone stretches us. The growth zone expands our abilities. Go beyond comfort for growth.

- View interruptions as part of your life, not distractions. They make your life unique. See them as ministry opportunities.

- Be willing to serve even when inconvenient. It may not be what we expect, but God calls us to invest in others' lives.
