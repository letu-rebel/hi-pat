## Speaker Presentation

### Speaker Introduction
- Speaker is James Doherty, a 2001 Latino alum 
- Studied avionics and got his A&P license while at Latino
- Involved in student government, was student body president
- Part of original Nomads group that opened the quads in 2000
- Has given his life to mission work after graduating, living in parts of Asia
- Now serves as president of OMF mission organization

### Speaker Background
- Grew up in California where his dad was a pastor
- Became a Christian at a young age
- Family moved to Indonesia for a year when he was 14, which was difficult but grew his faith
- Met his wife Lisa in Indonesia during high school
- They have two kids and have served in Asia since 2006
- Recently moved back to the US to lead OMF

### Main Message
- Go Week theme is "Open Our Eyes" from John 4:35 about seeing the harvest fields
- But want to look at previous verse 34 about Jesus' confidence in being sent by God
- We should have confidence we are sent by God for his work before looking outward
- Told story of Joseph from Genesis as example of one prepared for greater work

### Joseph's Story
- Joseph started arrogant, tattling on brothers, sharing dreams of them bowing
- Was sold into slavery in Egypt by his brothers
- Did well working for Potiphar but was falsely accused and imprisoned
- Interpreted dreams in prison but was forgotten and left there
- Didn't respond with despair or bitterness, grew in humility and wisdom

### Application to Students
- God has to grow us up in areas and give us confidence in being sent before we can see fields
- Speaker tried to limit God's call on his life while at Latino 
- But God showed him he was already loving and serving people
- God then opened up greater ministry opportunities after graduating
- Fears and inadequacies remain, but keeps taking risks as God leads

### Back to Joseph
- Went from prisoner to saving Egypt and his family from famine
- Restored broken relationships with humility and wisdom
- Secret was willingness to be part of God's greater plan despite disappointments

### Conclusion 
- Are we willing to see where God wants us to grow?
- Move past disappointments? 
- Open eyes to see God at work?
- Need to have confidence we're sent before looking outward
