## Chapel Speaker Presentation

The speaker, Dr. Mason, reflects on the meaning of convocation - a calling together and orienting as an academic faith community. He emphasizes that it is intentional to hold convocation in the chapel, as this is where the community gathers weekly to reorient studies, lives, teaching and learning around the worship of Jesus Christ. 

The speaker asks who we are following in life - on social media or otherwise. Who we follow indicates our values and aspirations. He notes the most followed people on Instagram and Twitter are celebrities, highlighting our cultural focus on status, wealth, popularity, etc.  

In contrast, the speaker reflects on his own 30 years of following Jesus since deciding to devote his life to Christ as a teenager. He connects this to the Scripture passage in Matthew where Jesus calls his first disciples, telling them to immediately leave everything and follow him. 

The speaker challenges students to consider what "nets" they need to leave behind to wholeheartedly follow Jesus. For some it may be putting the past or old lifestyles behind. For others it may be leaving securities like family, livelihood, future plans. He urges students to leave their "boats" and follow Jesus without delay.

The speaker notes Jesus' healing of the sick, saying some students need healing emotionally, mentally or spiritually. He encourages sharing struggles with others and pursuing healing through Christ. 

In closing, the speaker emphasizes that worldly success, status and followers do not matter in light of our need for spiritual healing and wholeness. He calls students to drop their nets, get out of the boat, and follow Jesus - leaving everything else behind. This new academic year represents a fresh start to devote one's life completely to Christ.
