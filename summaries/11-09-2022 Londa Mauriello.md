## Speaker's Presentation

### Introduction
- The speaker is Slanda Mario, the spiritual life coordinator at LeTourneau. 

### What is God's Will for My Life?
- God's will can seem mysterious, but the goal isn't to leave knowing the next 10 steps. After 40 years as a Christian, the speaker shares 3 things learned about discerning God's will:
  1. Don't make it more about you than God. 
  2. God's word is silent about some things regarding His will.
  3. God's word does say a lot of things about His will for your life.

### Don't Make it About You
- The emphasis should be on God, not yourself, when discerning His will. Ask yourself - are you focused on God's will or your life? 

### God's Word is Silent on Some Things
- God's will for specifics like what to wear or who to marry won't be found directly in Scripture. But other truths can guide us:
  - God will never leave or forsake us.
  - God will go before us and guide us. 
  - God knows us because He created us.
  - God gave us free will to make choices.
  - God's will never contradicts Scripture.

### God's Word Says a Lot About His Will  
- Scripture clearly states some aspects of God's will:
  - It is God's will that we be saved. 
  - It is God's will that we be sanctified.
  - It is God's will that we be submitted to authority.
  - It is God's will that we be spiritual - rejoice, pray, give thanks.

### Application
- Some decisions have clear biblical direction, while others are good choices between two options.
- The speaker shares an example of having to choose between marriage and overseas missions. After prayer and counsel, she realized both were good choices aligned with biblical principles. She chose marriage and has never regretted it or felt it wasn't God's will. 

### Additional Thoughts
- Wait, learn about yourself, seek counsel, and join where God is working. The emphasis should remain on God's will, not your own.

### Closing 
- The speaker prays for those discerning God's will and makes prayer partners available. God's will is that all would be saved and know Him.
