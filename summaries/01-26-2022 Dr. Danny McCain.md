## Speaker's Presentation

### Introduction
- Previously discussed Isaiah's call from God and his response to go
- Now want to focus on the sending aspect after the call
- Calling is only the first part, must also send people out to accomplish God's work  

### Jesus Sending Out His Disciples
- Jesus called 12 disciples and taught them what they needed to know
- Gave them motivation and funding, now it was time to send them out
- Jesus sent them out to reflect what he had been doing - preach and heal

### Two Parts of Jesus' Ministry
- Preaching/teaching - introduced a new kind of Kingdom, explained its nature
- Practical ministries - delivered people, healed the sick, helped in many ways
- These two made up Jesus' balanced ministry like two arms 

### Keeping Ministries in Balance
- Jesus kept preaching/teaching and practical ministries in balance
- Number of references to "preach" and "teach" were balanced with references to "heal" and "touch"
- Percentage of Jesus' words (red letters) was balanced with his deeds (black letters)

### Learning to Use Both Hands
- Speaker went to Africa focused on preaching, teaching, writing 
- But Africa had many practical needs he had to respond to
- Gives examples of helping many people in need while there
- Has learned to become more balanced in ministry

### Influencing the World
- Parable of mustard seed illustrates slow growth of God's Kingdom 
- Parable of yeast illustrates influence - a little affects the whole
- As Kingdom grows, it influences more and more of the world

### Reaching the World Requires More Than Full-Time Ministers  
- Going to take more than pastors and missionaries to fully reach the world
- Perhaps only 1% of people are full-time Christian workers
- Need to involve lay people, non-full-time workers, in all professions
- Must train lay people to help bring the Gospel into every area of society

### Conclusion
- Thankful for those called to traditional ministry roles
- But God is sending all believers to influence the world in their spheres
- Must accept this call to build God's Kingdom in all disciplines and professions

Overall, the speaker emphasized the need for balance in ministry between proclamation and practical service, and argued that reaching the full world requires the involvement of all Christians in every domain of society, not just those in vocational ministry. The talk centered on responding to Jesus' commission to preach, teach, and heal by allowing Him to influence all areas of life and culture.
