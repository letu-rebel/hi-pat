## Chapel Speaker Presentation Summary

The speaker, Dr. Mays, began by introducing the semester's chapel theme - "Reconciled to Reconcile." He explained that this is a process that starts with God and ends with God. 

### What Reconciliation Means

- To reconcile means to bring together and check records for accuracy, like reconciling a bank statement. 

- It can refer to restoring broken relationships between people. 

- Paul used this term to describe what God has done for the Corinthians - reconciled them to Himself through Christ.

### Key Points About Reconciliation 

- Reconciliation is initiated by God - it all comes from Him.

- Through Christ's work, reconciliation removes our sin. 

- We who are reconciled now become "reconcilers" ourselves, entrusted with the ministry of reconciliation. 

### Application to the Corinthians

- Paul was calling the Corinthians to live into the reconciliation God gave them and become reconcilers to each other and the world.

- This should be the nature of Christians and the church - reconciled by God's grace, we become ministers of reconciliation.

### Application to Letourneau

- We are called to be a community of Christ, reconciled by his grace, finding forgiveness and becoming reconcilers. 

- We are "reconciled to reconcile."

### Stories of Reconciliation

- The speaker told the stories of Jesus reconciling Zacchaeus and Matthew. Both responded to grace by reconciling with others. 

### Call to Action

- The speaker challenged students to receive God's reconciliation this semester, or to step into the ministry of reconciliation. 

- He concluded by praying the Aaronic Blessing over the congregation, a blessing of God's favor, presence, and peace.
