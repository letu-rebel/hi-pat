### Worship Summary

- The service opened with a call to worship from Psalm 51, with the congregation reading responsively. This psalm was written by David after he had sinned, and it expresses his desire for God's restoration and reconciliation. 

- The worship team led the congregation in singing songs like "Joy in the House", "Living Hope", and "The Blessing." The lyrics focused on praising God, declaring his goodness and faithfulness, trusting in his promises, and receiving his blessing. 

- There were multiple prayers throughout the service, including one at the start asking for God's presence and movement among the community during the semester. The final prayer thanked God for his reconciliation through Christ and asked for his blessing over the semester. 

- The overall spirit of worship seemed to be one of gratitude, dependence on God, and expectation for what he would do in the upcoming semester. The congregation sang praises to God for who he is and what he has done.


## Chapel Speaker Presentation Summary

The speaker, Dr. Mays, began by introducing the chapel theme for the semester - "Reconciled to Reconcile." 

### What Reconciliation Means

- To reconcile means to bring together and resolve differences. It can apply to relationships or financial accounts.  
- God initiates reconciliation with us, offering his grace and removing our sin through Christ's work. 
- We become "reconcilers" ourselves, sharing the ministry of reconciliation as ambassadors for Christ.

### Reconciliation in Corinth

- The speaker gave background on the ancient city of Corinth, known for sexual immorality. 
- Paul established a church there, but issues like factionalism and sexual sin crept in. 
- Through his letters, Paul patiently reminds them to live into the reconciliation from God, not their past sins and brokenness. 
- 2 Corinthians 5 - If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. Through Christ, God reconciled the world to himself.

### Reconciled to Reconcile

- We receive reconciliation from God, which balances our account with him. 
- We are then invited to become reconcilers ourselves in Christ's name. 
- This should be the nature of Christians, the church, and the Letourneau community.

### Zacchaeus and Matthew

- The speaker told the stories of Jesus reconciling with Zacchaeus and Matthew.
- In both cases, receiving reconciliation led them to reconcile with others. 
- But people questioned and rejected this kind of shocking grace.

### Application

- The speaker challenged students to receive God's reconciliation this semester if needed, and to step into the ministry of reconciliation. 
- "Get used to different" - living in God's reconciliation is different than the world's ways.  
- We are reconciled to reconcile.
