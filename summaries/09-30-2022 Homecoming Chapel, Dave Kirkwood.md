## Chapel Speaker Presentation

### Introduction

- The speaker was Dave Kirkwood, a Letourneau alum from the class of 1995. 
- He was introduced by his friend Kurt Fitchett, also a Letourneau alum. Kurt spoke about Dave's perseverance after a serious illness in college left him hospitalized and paralyzed.

### Dave's Background

- Dave grew up in a Christian home and always dreamed of being an Air Force pilot. His family moved to Texas during high school so he could attend Letourneau for the aviation program.

### College Years

- At Letourneau, Dave studied engineering technology with an aviation focus. He was active on campus, sang in the men's chorus, and worked campus security.  
- Between sophomore and junior year, he got his pilot's license. 
- In the summer of 1995, Dave contracted bacterial meningitis and ended up paralyzed after being in a coma for 2 months. Doctors said he would never walk again.

### Recovery and Perseverance

- After a year of rehab, Dave learned to walk again with prosthetic legs and hands. He was determined to prove the doctors wrong.
- He went back to school and graduated from Letourneau. He got the nickname "Super Dave" for his perseverance.

### Career and Family 

- After graduating, Dave started a medical device company and patented a lightweight wheelchair. The company ultimately closed.
- He met his wife Rebecca and they started a franchise business together in 2017. That same year their daughter was diagnosed with cancer and had her leg amputated.

### Reflecting on God's Plan

- Dave spoke about exchanging our plans for God's plans. This requires surrender, faith, and joy. 
- God's plan is not to deprive us but to secure our hearts for the greater good of following him. 
- Dave closed in prayer, thanking God for the chance to gather with fellow believers at Letourneau.
