# Reconciled to Reconcile

## Introduction

- The speaker, Dr. Maize, introduces the chapel theme for the semester: "Reconciled to Reconcile." 

- He explains that reconciliation starts with God and ends with God. It is a process that God initiates.

## Reconciliation 

- To reconcile means to bring two records or accounts together for accuracy. 

- It can apply to financial accounts or relationships. 

- Reconciling a relationship takes grace and forgiveness on both sides.

## Reconciliation in Scripture

- The speaker explores the biblical concept of reconciliation, referencing 2 Corinthians 5 where Paul writes that through Christ, God reconciled the world to himself. 

- Key points:

  - Reconciliation is initiated by God

  - It removes our sin through Christ's work

  - We become reconcilers ourselves with the ministry of reconciliation

- We receive reconciliation from God and are invited to become reconcilers representing Christ.

## Case Studies

- The speaker illustrates reconciliation through the biblical examples of Zacchaeus and Matthew. 

- Both were despised tax collectors who experienced grace and acceptance from Jesus. 

- This reconciliation inspired them to make amends and positively impact others.

## Application

- The speaker encourages the chapel audience to receive God's reconciliation and forgiveness.

- He also challenges them to step into the ministry of reconciliation as Christ's ambassadors.

- The reconciled life is about living differently with God's blessing.

## Conclusion

- The speaker concludes by praying that the Letourneau community would share in God's blessing and practice reconciliation.
