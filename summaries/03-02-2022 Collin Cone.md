## Transition to Message About Words
- Discussed how we use many words daily, but can lose sight of their value and weight. The Bible teaches that words matter. 

## Words Have Power
- Quoted Proverbs 18:21 - life and death are in the power of the tongue. 
- Quoted Matthew 12:36 - we'll be judged for careless words.
- Argued words are not meaningless or benign based on these verses.

## Why Words Matter
- Quoted James 3:3-5a - small things like bits and rudders direct large animals and ships. Likewise, the tongue directs our lives.
- Our words set the direction and destination of our lives, even from a young age.
- Gave examples of declarations that negatively impacted lives.

## Words Can Destroy
- Quoted James 3:5b-6 - the tongue is a fire that can corrupt and ruin lives.
- Like sparks that cause forest fires, careless words destroy lives. 
- Gave examples of declarations that set destructive patterns in motion.

## Words Can Redirect
- If words can direct lives one way, they can also redirect lives another way.
- Encouraged making new, positive declarations over our lives.
- Echoing God's truth is powerful - offered examples of declarations from Scripture.

## Impact Others
- Quoted Proverbs 15:1 - gentle words diffuse anger.
- Our words can either stir up or calm rage in our culture.
- Quoted Proverbs 12:18 - wise words bring healing.
- We should use words to promote healing rather than pierce like swords.

## Reveal the Heart
- Quoted Luke 6:45 - the mouth speaks from the overflow of the heart.
- Our words reveal who we truly are, especially when we are angry.  
- If our words are destructive, we need Jesus to transform our hearts.

## Closing Prayer
- Prayed that we would value words and use them to bring life, hope, and healing.
- Asked for heart transformation if our words reveal sinful hearts.
