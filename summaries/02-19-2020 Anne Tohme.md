# Speaker's Presentation

Ann Tomei, Director of Student Care at Trinity International University, focused her talk on the parable of the Prodigal Son found in Luke 15. She examined the compassionate heart of the father in the story.

## Key Points

- The focus of the parable should be on the welcoming father, not just the prodigal son. The story reveals the unconditional love and grace of God. 

- The father runs to embrace his son while he is still far off, before the son can even confess his sins. Reconciliation comes through the father's love, not the son's repentance. 

- The robes, ring, sandals, and feast that the father gives the son represent forgiveness, authority, sonship, and celebration. The father looks past the son's sins.

- The father also goes out to plead with the bitter, jealous older son to join the celebration. He offers the same unlimited grace to both sons, whether far or near.

- As we experience God's grace, we are called to "become the father" - to extend that same compassion and welcome to others. This means forgiving, rejoicing over the lost being found, and pursuing reconciliation.

- We follow Christ's model of embodying the welcoming, unconditionally loving heart of the father. Our lives should reflect this grace we've received.

## Closing Thoughts

- Tomei closed by emphasizing our call to be like the compassionate father, turning on all the lights and welcoming everyone home. God desires to bring all His children home.
