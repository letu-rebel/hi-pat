## Speaker Presentation Summary

The speaker, Anne Tomei, focused her talk on the parable of the Prodigal Son found in Luke 15. She examined Rembrandt's famous painting of this parable, noting how the central focus is on the compassionate father embracing his son. 

### The Heart of the Father

- The father in the parable represents God's divine love for humanity.  
- Key details showing the father's love:
    - He sees his son while he is still far off and is filled with compassion.
    - He runs to embrace his son, which was culturally undignified. 
    - He reconciles with his son before any confession of sin.
    - His love is unconditional and compels him to welcome his son home.
- The father's extravagant celebration with robe, ring, etc. symbolically replies to the son's confession and shows full reconciliation.

### Becoming the Father 

- As we experience God's grace, we are called not just to remain as sons/daughters but to become like the father.
- We must extend the same radical grace and unconditional welcome to others. 
- Practically this means:
    - Letting go of the need to be right
    - Getting comfortable with discomfort
    - Reaching out to those marginalized
    - Celebrating others' success
    - Forgiving without demanding apology
    
### The Elder Son

- The father also seeks out the elder bitter son who refuses to celebrate.
- He gently pleads with this son too, showing unlimited grace. 
- The elder son must choose to accept or reject the father's unconditional love.

### Closing Thoughts

- The father's welcome is for all - both the lost and the bitter. 
- As we grow in grace, we become more like the father, extending welcome.
- We are called to be like Christ and let others see the Father through us.
