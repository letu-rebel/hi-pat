## Sermon Summary

### Introduction
- The speaker is Todd Countess, senior pastor of New Beginnings Baptist Church
- He expresses joy at the opportunity to speak to the students 
- Believes this generation of students will usher in the greatest gospel movement ever seen

### Main Points

#### We are sent by His power
- Jesus has been given all authority in heaven and on earth
- This authority reminds us of Daniel's vision of the Son of Man's everlasting dominion
- Jesus demonstrated his authority through miracles and by conquering death through his resurrection
- Every person will eventually bow their knee to Jesus as Lord, either willfully or through His wrath

#### We are sent for His purpose
- The command in the Great Commission is to "make disciples" 
- This means introducing people to Jesus, connecting them to the church, and teaching them to obey Jesus
- The goal is disciple-making disciples - raising up followers who can make more followers
- Illustrates exponential spread of disciple-making over 5 years starting with just 2 people

#### We are sent with His presence 
- Jesus promises "I am with you always, to the end of the age"
- This refers to the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in believers
- The Spirit brings Jesus' resurrection power and accompanies believers in the mission
- Believers' courage and confidence is found in the presence of the Spirit, not themselves
- Prayer and pursuing Jesus is key to relying on the Spirit's power for the mission

### Conclusion
- Students must say "yes" to following Jesus and committing to His mission
- They should consider how to leverage their careers and talents for God's kingdom
- When walking in the Spirit's power, there is confidence to live out God's purpose
