## Speaker Presentations

### Dr. Vicki Schaefer

- Shared about desert experiences and vulnerable times during her 28 years at LeTourneau. 

- Began feeling tired and depressed, took a long time to recognize it. Felt shame as a psychologist needing help. Thoughts grew more negative. Finally started seeing a counselor, was difficult to be the one needing help. 

- Husband got new traveling job, she withdrew more when he was away. Went away for a month over Christmas, she spiraled downward. 

- Started spring semester but knew she couldn't continue. Spent weekend contemplating suicide. Called counselor and friend, went to hospital and checked in voluntarily. Felt like a failure. 

- Husband visited, spent hour saying she was ruining his career, needed to get herself together. She got released, still not ready. He gave her 6 more months to improve or he'd leave.

- Struggled through semester, went on medical leave arranged by dean. Felt it was final blow. Husband left after semester. Verse God gave her: "A bruised reed he will not break."

- Did intensive treatment for 6 weeks. Group learned she was Christian psychologist, welcomed rather than mocked her. Another verse: "But God..."

- Thankful for community sitting with her in ashes, and celebrating mountaintops together. Shared 1 Corinthians 12 on body sharing in suffering and honor.

### Mr. Fred Ritchie

- Shared about unexpected turns and God's unexpected movements. 

- Attended LeTourneau with dad in 1975 after his Army retirement. Majored in aviation, dated wife Gail in high school, she transferred to LeTourneau. 

- Married in 1978, lived in campus married housing. Graduated in 1980, worked as mechanic before mission aviation. 

- In 1984, decided to join mission organization. But God took them in unexpected direction - said not to pursue missions. Felt lost. 

- In November 1984, offered faculty job at LeTourneau. Surprised but saw it as ministry opportunity. Started teaching in 1985. Became department chair and dean. 

- Life filled with unexpected turns and blessings. Still learning to expect God's surprises - difficulties and new opportunities. 

- Encouraged students to expect God to step into their lives in unimaginable ways. If not given life to Jesus, encouraged them to do so. 

- Closed in prayer thanking God for undeserved gifts and asking for strengthening, encouragement, and surprising movements.
