## Chapel Speaker Presentation Summary

Brian Birdsall spoke about the importance of being convinced of the truth of the gospel message. 

He discussed his connection to LeTourneau University through founder R.G. LeTourneau's work in Peoria, Illinois. LeTourneau brought his earth moving equipment factory to Peoria, making it the "earth moving capital of the world." 

Birdsall emphasized that we must have a firm conviction regarding the truth of the gospel in order to be effective witnesses. He outlined the difference between opinion, belief, and conviction. Opinions are often not fact-based, beliefs can change, but convictions hold people to certain behaviors.

He examined the essence of the gospel message as distilled by Paul in 1 Corinthians 15 - that Christ died for our sins, was buried, rose again, and appeared to many eyewitnesses. Birdsall framed this with four key questions: Who is Jesus? What has he done? Why has he done this? How can I know this is true? 

The Apostles' Creed expands on this gospel essence with trinitarian theology and other core doctrines. Statements of faith help organizations like Campus Crusade for Christ stay on track doctrinally from generation to generation. 

Birdsall is convinced the gospel is powerful to save and that it is the Holy Spirit, not our own eloquence, that brings people to salvation. He closed urging students to dive deep into the resources at LeTourneau to strengthen their faith and become convinced of the historic, orthodox gospel. This conviction holds us to live and speak the gospel faithfully wherever we are called.
