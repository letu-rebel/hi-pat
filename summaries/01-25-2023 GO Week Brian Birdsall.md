- Pastor Gabriel Willis prayed, thanking God for the chapel event and asking that God would clear their hearts and minds to focus on Him during worship. He prayed they would celebrate God's work on campus and around the world. 

- The congregation sang "No One Like You" which declares there is no one like God and asks Him to open their eyes to see Him more clearly.

- Dr. Mays closed the worship time in prayer, thanking God for not leaving them alone but drawing them to Himself. He prayed they would participate in God's ministry of reconciliation, and asked for guidance in this work. He gave God praise and glory through Jesus Christ.


## Summary of Chapel Speaker's Presentation

- The speaker, Brian Birdsall, works with Christian Embassy at the United Nations. He and his wife have been there for 10 years, working to build relationships and share the gospel with diplomats and ambassadors. 

- The passage for the talk is 2 Corinthians 5:16-21, focusing on verses 19-20 about being given the ministry and message of reconciliation and being Christ's ambassadors.

- As ambassadors to the UN, Brian has insight into what that role entails. Ambassadors have the highest rank and are invested with power to speak on behalf of their nation's leader. They take messaging very seriously. 

- In light of being Christ's ambassadors, Brian points to 1 Peter 3:15 about being prepared to give an answer and reason for our hope. He gives two practical points:

  1. Be prepared to share your story succinctly in 3 minutes - before Christ, how you came to faith, changes afterward.

  2. Be prepared to share the essence of the gospel succinctly and compellingly in 10 minutes, using a visual aid if possible.

- Preparation is key. Stories are powerful and preparation shows you take the ambassador role seriously. 

- Brian challenges them that if they want to take the motto "every workplace and every nation" seriously, they must fully commit to the ambassador role and be prepared. 

- He closes urging them to be convinced, compelled, and committed to the ministry of reconciliation as Christ's ambassadors.
