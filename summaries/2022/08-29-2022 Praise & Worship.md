# Speaker Presentation

## Speaker Introduction
- The speaker is Elizabeth Roberts, a graduating senior studying Scripture and Theology. She transferred from Moody Bible Institute and is friends with Peter and Bailey.

## Speaker's Background
- Elizabeth has known Jesus almost her whole life. In high school, God made himself known to her and she fell in love with Him. 

- During this time, she was also very depressed after learning about abuse in a close family and that she had been sexually abused. 

- For the first half of 10th grade, she was very close to God, reading her Bible and feeling His presence.

## God's Silence
- In the second half of 10th grade, God suddenly went silent. Elizabeth no longer heard the Holy Spirit or felt God's presence.

- She wept over her Bible for hours asking God to meet her, but felt abandoned. Her prayers seemed to disappear.

- This silence from God has continued for 8 years now. Elizabeth is now 24 and hasn't felt God's presence since age 16.

## Reactions from Others
- When she has shared about God's silence, people have asked if she is in sin, needs to read her Bible more, try fasting, or speak in tongues. But none of these have restored God's presence.

## Learning to Wait
- In fall 2020, Elizabeth concluded that God works in periods of pain and waiting. 

## Walking Through Psalm 22
- Her brother introduced her to Psalm 22 in high school about feeling abandoned by God. 

- She reads Psalm 22, focusing on verses 1, 16, and 18 that prophesy Jesus' crucifixion.

- Like David, she has wrestled with feeling abandoned by God. But she is more in love with Jesus now than at age 16.

## Reflection on God's Presence
- God's presence is not based on feelings. He has taught her He is more than what is felt. 

- Seeking a feeling can be grasping at something fleeting. God invites a deeper knowledge of Him.

- Though abandoned feeling, Elizabeth testifies to God's work in her life - healing, community, learning His Word. 

- Take heart in the community of Christians also feeling abandoned. Wait for the new heaven and earth to finally bask in God's presence.

## Closing Encouragement
- Your relationship with God does not depend on feelings, even in abandonment. Be in fellowship with Christians. You are not alone.
