### Worship Summary

- Bailey led a responsive reading from Luke about how Jesus sits and eats with sinners. This ties into the theme of Lo's message.

- Bailey prayed, thanking God for the time together, asking God to bless the speakers and work in people's hearts, and to guide the worship time. 

- Abby and Raymond led worship with 3 songs:
  - "Reckless Love" 
  - "King of My Heart"
  - "Lion and the Lamb"

- The songs focused on God's love, grace, and worthiness of praise. There was an overall sentiment of gratitude, awe, and celebration of who God is.

- Abby prayed after worship, thanking God for taking people as they are with grace upon grace. She acknowledged people have nothing to offer God but He loves them anyway. She gave the time to God, believing He will do a mighty work.


### Speaker Presentation Summary

- The speaker, Lo Allmond, continued his talk from Monday about seeing the way God sees. 

- He shared a story about potty training his defiant daughter Emerson. They rewarded her with donuts each time she successfully used the potty. 

- Over time, Emerson started believing her worth was tied to whether she could "perform" and get a donut. The parents had unintentionally instilled an unhealthy narrative about her identity. 

- Similarly, people can take on narratives that their worth is based on metrics like grades, appearance, popularity rather than how God sees them. 

- Jesus says the eye is the lamp of the body - if your eye is healthy your body will be full of light. The stories we believe shape how we see the world.

- In Jesus' time there were 3 main narratives: tragedy (find your own meaning), comedy (no meaning in the world), and religion (find meaning outside this world). 

- In Luke 15, Jesus tells parables to present a different narrative - when lost, the Father seeks you, you're valuable to Him.

- The prodigal son story is not about deserving forgiveness but about the worth the Father places on the son. 

- The emphasis is on the Father's heart, not the son's brokenness. Jesus became the seeking Shepherd and Father staring down the road waiting for us.

- The point is not just being forgiven, but being brought into relationship. We need to see ourselves through the story of God's relentless love.
