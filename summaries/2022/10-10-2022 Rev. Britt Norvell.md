## Chapel Speaker Presentation Summary

The speaker, Reverend Britton Orville, began with the story of St. Francis of Assisi's conversion - how after refusing to help a beggar, Francis later sought him out to give him all the money he had. This led Francis to found an order that gave away possessions to serve the poor. 

The speaker said this illustrates how we all face moments where we must choose to see and help those in need, or ignore them. He noted how our culture debates justice, with some co-opting the term and others saying Christians shouldn't focus on justice. Underneath is a debate about who is blessed and cursed, deserving or undeserving. 

Jesus challenged cultural expectations in his parable of the rich man and Lazarus. Jesus gave Lazarus, the poor man, a name meaning "God helps," signaling he is blessed despite his poverty. The rich man ends up tormented in Hades, showing possessions don't mean God's blessing. Jesus overturned the idea that the rich deserve their wealth while the poor deserve their poverty.

The parable attacks wealth that doesn't see poverty and suffering. The rich man's wealth blinded him to Lazarus at his gate. We see what we're trained to see. The parable exposes how we fail to fully see others, assuming they deserve their fate. In reality, good and bad happen beyond people's control. 

Seeing like Jesus means seeing people's full humanity. Any gospel that doesn't include and empower the poor is not Jesus' gospel. Jesus' ministry showed concern for the poor, sick, and outcast. As God's people, we must see others as God sees them - as beloved images of God, not problems to fix. We cannot do justice until we have eyes to see the poor among us.

The speaker invited the congregation to ask God to open their eyes to see others' needs. He shared about his work with Longview Community Ministries providing food, financial aid, and dental care to those in crisis. He said they aim to give people relief so they can find solutions, connect to community, and fulfill their God-given purpose. Justice is God's work; we sow seeds of hope and care so people can thrive. 

The speaker concluded by praying for open eyes to see and care for those in need, and for grace to invite them into God's family. He gave thanks that though we were helpless, Christ saved us, and now sends us to live out His justice and love.
