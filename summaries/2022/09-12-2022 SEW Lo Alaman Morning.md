### Speaker Presentation Summary

- The speaker Low starts by introducing himself as a preacher, artist, and storyteller. He shares that he loves Jesus and cares about the students. 

- He talks about learning about God's goodness through his kids. His daughter Emerson taught him about Nutella, which he calls "chocolate crack cocaine." One morning he caught her covered in Nutella after she had climbed to reach it. When he confronted her, she denied eating it despite being covered in chocolate. 

- This reminds Low of God asking Adam and Eve "Where are you?" after they sinned. They tried to hide their sin from God, just as his daughter tried to hide her chocolate-covered face. God wants to lock eyes with us, call out our sin, and help us see correctly again. 

- Low explains that prophecy means seeing things from God's perspective. 1 Corinthians 14 instructs us to eagerly desire the gift of prophecy - to see ourselves and others as God sees us. 

- Seeing ourselves and others clearly requires vulnerability. It means allowing God to critique and correct us. Low shares a story of how his wife critiquing his self-taught piano playing was difficult for him to hear at first. 

- Like with the woman at the well in John 4, Jesus sees us fully and calls out our sin, but still invites us to relationship. He is full of grace and truth. 

- God wants to draw us into deeper intimacy with Him, into prophetic relationship where we see Him clearly. We must cultivate our love for God through seeking Him. 

- Low closes by reading a poem about a hurting girl who is running from God. It depicts how Jesus pursues her, washes her sins away, and reminds her of His unfailing love and mercy each new morning.

Overall, Low emphasizes that God wants us to see ourselves, others, and Him accurately. This requires vulnerability but leads to intimacy with Christ as we seek Him earnestly.
