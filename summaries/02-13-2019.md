# Summary of Chapel Speaker's Presentation

## Introduction
- John McCollum is the co-founder and executive director of Asia's Hope, an organization providing family-style orphan care in Cambodia, Thailand, and India. 

## The Unsettling Gap
- There is an "unsettling gap" between the God depicted in the Bible who cares for the oppressed and what we see happening in the world.
- 150 million orphaned children exist today, more than the entire world population when the Bible was written. 
- This leads people to conclude either God doesn't exist or he isn't good.

## God's Promises to the Oppressed
- The Bible is full of God's promises to rescue the fatherless and widows. 
- God says he will hear their cries and bring justice.
- But we don't see visible divine intervention on a grand scale.

## Miracles vs. God's Normal Means
- Miracles happen but are not God's primary way of working.
- His main strategy is activating his people, not miraculous intervention.

## How God Fulfills Promises  
1. God hears cries of the oppressed.
2. God distributes wealth to his people. 
3. God calls his people to action.

## The Blessing of Serving
- Using wealth for others is not just responsibility but blessing.
- Adding "rescuer of the oppressed" to our vocations brings joy.

## A Story of Rescue
- Story of Lai, Srei Mao, and Mom rescued in Cambodia by Asia's Hope.
- Example of God calling Wes and Dawn Polsdorfer to fund their care.

## Challenge to the Students
- Make choices now to build a life of sacrifice and service.
- Discover the greater vocations of serving the vulnerable.
- Don't live with regret, but be God's answer to prayers.
