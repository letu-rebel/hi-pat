## Speaker's Presentation

The speaker, Dr. Belcher, opened by talking about his daughter and her experience adjusting to college life and community as an introvert. He related this to how community at Letourneau can feel forced or overwhelming at first, but meaningful community can develop over time. 

He then transitioned to discussing the theme of "the shared life" for the semester. He referenced Acts 16-17, which describes Paul's second missionary journey where he faced persecution but also planted churches and experienced deep bonds with new believers. 

The speaker focused on Paul's relationship with the Thessalonian church that he had briefly visited. Though Paul was forced to leave quickly, he wrote back to them with great affection, saying "We loved you so much that we were delighted to share with you not only the gospel of God but our lives as well, because you had become so dear to us." (1 Thess 2:8)

Dr. Belcher highlighted three aspects of the shared life:

- A relational life - the everyday interactions, activities, and events that happen in community.

- A new life - the life all believers share through faith in Jesus Christ. This is the gospel message. 

- The life of God - The love of God that spills into creation and invites us into flourishing, abundant life. 

The speaker explained that this shared life of relationship, gospel living, and God's love is the blessing Paul wanted for the Thessalonians and is the blessing we can experience at Letourneau. 

He then discussed launching new prayer initiatives this semester to facilitate the shared life, inviting Krista Anderson, Prof. Craig Olson, and Student Body President Matthew Strong on stage to share about the importance of prayer.

Dr. Belcher closed by leading the congregation in singing the Priestly Blessing from Numbers 6, praying it as a blessing over the Letourneau community.
