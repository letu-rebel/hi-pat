- Check your syllabus and with your professor about whether your Tuesday class the week of Thanksgiving will be cancelled. Some classes may meet that day, while others will not. 

- Midterm grade check-ins will be submitted soon. If you receive a concerning grade or comment, someone may reach out to discuss ways the university can further support your academic success through resources like tutoring. This is meant to help, not invade your personal space.

- Enjoy the fun energy on campus between Thanksgiving and Christmas break. It's a busy time with finals approaching, but also a season of traditions and excitement before going home.
