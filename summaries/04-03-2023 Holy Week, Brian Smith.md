## The Meaning of Shalom

- Shalom is a Hebrew word that means more than just peace. It refers to a state of completeness and wholeness. 

- Life is complex with many moving parts. Shalom is when everything is working together in harmony.

- Shalom can refer to something physical, like a stone with no cracks or a wall with no gaps. 

- It can also refer to relationships, like when David asked about his brothers' wellbeing using the word shalom.

## Shalom with God

- What does shalom look like in our relationship with God? 

- Genesis 1-2 shows shalom - God walking with Adam and Eve in the garden, fully known and loved.

- Luke 3 shows God declaring Jesus as his beloved Son, pleased with him. Shalom is based on sonship, not performance.

- We want God to know us fully and delight in us. God wants that too.

## How Shalom Breaks Down

- Sin prevents shalom with God. Sin means missing the mark of God's perfection. 

- We all sin and fall short of God's glory. The wages of sin is death.

- We are not naturally God's children, adoption into his family is required.

## Restoring Shalom through Jesus

- Jesus lived a perfect life in our place, did what we could not do.

- He willingly died on the cross, satisfying God's wrath towards sin. 

- His resurrection proves victory over sin and death.

- If we believe Jesus is Lord and God raised him from the dead, we are saved.

- This salvation is also adoption into God's family. God looks at us as beloved children.

- Our right standing is based on what Jesus did, not our good works.

## Call to Faith

- For those who believe, remember your delight comes from what God has done. 

- For those who haven't believed, plead to receive the gift of salvation and adoption.

- God loves you and wants you as his beloved child. Believe and receive this gift.
