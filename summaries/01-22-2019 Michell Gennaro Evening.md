## Speaker Presentation Summary

Michelle Gennaro shared about how God turned her world upside down when her husband Chris suddenly died while they were serving as missionaries in Africa. She explained that it was the 5-year anniversary of the day the infection began that would eventually take Chris's life. 

Gennaro showed a notebook from when they first went to Africa as missionaries in 2008. On the first page, Chris had drawn the phrase "Life always comes out of death." This proved prophetic, as Chris died in 2013 but God brought life from his death.

Gennaro then shared 5 ways to live out the theme of turning the world upside down for Jesus, based on 1 John 3:11-24:

1. **Love Dangerously** - Die to self and lay down your life for others, like Jesus did. Love through actions, not just words.

2. **Hope Tirelessly** - Hope in God, not circumstances. Have confidence in God who knows all things. 

3. **Cling to Truth** - Don't listen to lies from others or yourself. Take thoughts captive and cling to God's Word.

4. **Maintain Integrity** - Live differently so others see Christ in you. Be ready to share the hope you have. 

5. **Obey His Commands** - Love God, believe in Jesus, love others, make disciples. Allow suffering to prepare you to comfort others.

Gennaro closed by commissioning students to pour out their lives, walk out their faith, and live for eternal purpose. She challenged them to take the gospel to unreached people groups.
