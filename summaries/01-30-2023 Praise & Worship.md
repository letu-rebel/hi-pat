## Chapel Speaker Presentation

Max begins by introducing himself and sharing that he grew up in the Middle East and moved to the US 6 years ago. He has grown in his faith and mindset at LeTourneau. 

### Personal Struggles

Max shares some recent personal struggles:

- His best friend attempted suicide and rejected help when Max talked about God. 

- Max's dad had a seizure, and then was diagnosed with brain cancer. 

- Two of Max's closest friends were in a car accident.

Max was angry at God and questioned how a loving God could allow this. He wanted to get close to God but had much anger.

### Lessons from Job

God reminded Max of the story of Job, who lost everything yet still worshipped God. Max reads Job 1:13-22, where Job loses his children, wealth, and health yet responds by worshipping God. 

Max notes that Job recognized his position before God and prioritized worship over accusing God. Job shows that following God includes thorns and pain.

### Choosing Perspective

Max chose to worship God despite his trials. He made a conscious choice to see life as a gift from God. Max heard God say "I'm listening" when Max cried out, which gave Max peace. 

Max encourages asking God for His perspective on life. If God wants you to see something differently, He will show you. Max started seeing life less as deserved and more as a gift to thank God for.

### Peace Through Struggles

Max says he could now face his dad's death or friend's illness with devastation yet also peace from God. He encourages striving for this peace and asking God for it specifically. His relationship with God grew to overcome struggles with peace.

### Call to Action

Max challenges students to worship God through struggles, pray and cry out to Him, and support one another. Look around - you are not alone in trials. Cry out to God - it's the best resort when struggling.
