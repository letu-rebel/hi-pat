## Speaker Presentation

The speaker, Andre Heagle, shared about his experiences with the Free Burma Rangers (FBR), a relief group that provides medical aid and shares the gospel in conflict areas. 

Andre grew up as a missionary kid in Malaysia. At age 17, his dad sent him to work with FBR in Burma. This was a pivotal time for Andre to fully commit his life to following Jesus. 

FBR operates in teams of 4 - a medic, someone to lead "Good Life Clubs" for kids, and 2 others. They have 2 key rules: 1) No decisions based on fear or comfort  2) If people you're with can't run, you stay with them.

FBR serves in Burma, where civil war and ethnic cleansing has caused immense suffering for decades. The Burmese Army attacks churches, villages and civilians. FBR teams provide medical aid, do VBS-style programs for kids, document atrocities, and share the gospel. 

Andre later attended college at Letourneau University and did ministry. After becoming a nurse, he joined an FBR team in Syria for 6 weeks. Syria is divided between Assad's regime, ISIS remnants, Kurdish forces, and foreign powers like Russia and Turkey. FBR provided medical aid and did "Good Life Clubs" for kids in former ISIS strongholds.

Serving in war zones has cost FBR team members their lives. But the gospel is worth living and dying for. FBR has trained over 200 "Rangers" who commit to loving others, forgiving, praying, acting with courage and never surrendering.

In closing, Andre emphasized the importance of boldly following God's call, whether as a teacher, nurse, pilot or wherever He leads. The world needs Christians to go into every workplace and nation with the good news of Christ.
