## Miss Laster's Presentation

### Reflecting on Her Faith Journey

- Grew up going to a Christian school and church, participated in Christian activities
- On the outside appeared to have a vibrant, growing faith  
- Chose to attend Letourneau, a Christian college
- But in reality struggled with lustful thoughts, sexual sin, pride, anger due to lack of boundaries
- At Letourneau, kept up a Christian appearance but sinful attitudes remained
- Enjoyed Bible verses about grace, but avoided verses about dying to sin  
- Continued to rationalize away her sins

### A Time of Questioning

- In her mid-30s, started questioning core Christian beliefs
- Wondered if Jesus really rose from the dead, if the Bible was copied correctly
- Struggled to reconcile her doubts with working at Letourneau as a Christian
- Began listening to podcasts, reading books that helped reconcile her faith questions
- Resources like the Breakpoint podcast and the book Cold-Case Christianity bolstered her faith

### The Colson Fellows Program

- Heard about the program on the Breakpoint podcast 
- Intensive 10-month Christian worldview program with readings, meetings, webinars
- Named after Charles Colson, founder of the Colson Center for Christian Worldview
- Helped her grow roots of faith and take ownership of beliefs
- Prompted thinking about redeeming culture, improving the world
- Gave her a plan for applying her faith after the program

### Reflecting on Letourneau

- Glad recent issues at Letourneau were brought to light for open discussion 
- Hopes it leads to creating a better culture of respect in the College of Aviation
- Suggests an honor code could help stop inappropriate comments and behavior
- Notes that real change starts with examining personal roots that produce good or bad fruit
- Encourages questioning and owning faith during time at Letourneau
