## The Prodigal Son - Luke 15:11-32

- Jesus tells a parable about a wealthy man with two sons. 

- The younger son asks for his inheritance early. The father divides his property and gives the younger son his share. 

- The younger son leaves for a distant country and wastes all his money in reckless living. A famine hits and he becomes destitute. 

- The younger son hires himself out to a pig farmer and longs to eat the pig food. He realizes his foolishness and decides to return to his father, repent of his sins, and ask to be a hired servant.

- As the son returns, the father sees him from afar, feels compassion, runs to him, embraces and kisses him. 

- The son confesses his sin, but the father calls for a celebration and restoration rather than treating him as a servant.

- The older brother who had remained faithful is angry. The father reminds him that he always had access to the father's love. 

- The parable shows God's love in seeking the lost and welcoming them back. We don't have to earn God's love through works.

## Key Points

- God eagerly awaits the return of the lost like the father seeking his younger son. 

- For those feeling far from God, return to Him who loves you. 

- Don't try to earn God's love through joyless discipline. You have access to it freely.

- Trust God who pursues you. Come and be reconciled.
