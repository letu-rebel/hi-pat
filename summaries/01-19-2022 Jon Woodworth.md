# Chapel Speaker Presentation Summary

## Speaker Introduction
- The speaker was Jonathan Woodworth, the missionaries-in-residence at LeTourneau. 
- He introduced his sermon topic on the story of Jonah and how it demonstrates God's mercy and grace in relenting or changing His mind. 

## Overview of Jonah Story
- The story only mentions a fish 3 times out of 48 verses, so it's about more than just the fish.
- It shows God's character in relenting or changing His mind to show mercy. 

## God's Mercy to the Sailors
- When the storm hit the ship, the sailors were fearful and fought for their lives. 
- After throwing Jonah overboard, the storm stopped and the sailors believed in God.
- This showed God's mercy in relenting from the storm when the sailors cried out to Him.

## God's Mercy to Jonah  
- Jonah cried out to God from inside the fish, repenting and recognizing God's salvation. 
- God had Jonah vomited onto dry land, giving him another chance.
- This showed God relenting in giving Jonah grace and mercy.

## God's Mercy to the Ninevites
- Jonah preached judgment, but the people repented in sackcloth and ashes.
- God relented from destroying the city when He saw their repentance. 
- Over 120,000 people were shown mercy and salvation.

## Jonah's Reaction
- Jonah was angry that God showed mercy to the Ninevites. 
- The story reveals Jonah's prejudice and God's great compassion.
- Jesus said "something greater than Jonah is here" referring to Himself.

## Main Point
- The story demonstrates God's incredible mercy, grace and compassion in relenting from judgment.
- It calls people to repentance and obedience to a loving God.
