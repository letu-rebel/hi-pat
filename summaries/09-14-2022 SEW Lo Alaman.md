### Speaker Presentation Summary

The speaker, Low, began by thanking the congregation for having him speak during Spiritual Emphasis Week. He joked that the campus culture seems dangerously close to being a cult. 

Low has been talking about how God invites people to see, pray, and prophesy. This allows people to be fully seen by God, see themselves in the biblical narrative, and carry God's prophetic vision into the world. 

Low discussed how names and stories shape identity and perspective. He used the example of Jacob being named the trickster, which influenced how he saw himself and the world. God can give people a new name and vision for their lives. 

The speaker read Exodus 3, where God calls Moses from the burning bush. God saw the suffering of his people in Egypt and felt concerned for them. God called Moses' name twice, showing his desire to call Moses deeper into relationship and repurpose the meaning of his name. 

Moses asked how he could lead the Israelites out of Egypt. But God said He would be with Moses - it wasn't about Moses' own abilities. God revealed his identity and plan to free his people from slavery. 

Low emphasized how God feels emotion alongside his people. Removing emotion from God makes him distant. Scripture shows God feels love, anger, jealousy, compassion, grief, and joy. 

When God sees, he calls people deeper, feels alongside them, and sends them to carry his vision into the world. Going on mission transforms both the receiver and giver. 

Low told a story of a troublemaking teen named Reagan who was transformed on a mission trip as he served others. After the trip, Low forgot he had confiscated Reagan's weed until he found it going through airport security years later. 

Low realized he had been unknowingly carrying someone else's baggage and brokenness. In the same way, people can carry false narratives about themselves. God wants to free them from these and give them a new vision rooted in Jesus.
