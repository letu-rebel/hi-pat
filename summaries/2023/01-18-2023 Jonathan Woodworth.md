## Chapel Speaker Presentation

- Speaker is Jonathan Wordsworth, missionary in residence at LeTourneau University with his wife Becky. 

- Theme is "convinced, compelled, committed" relating to missions and reconciling people to God.

- Quotes Dale Tackett - "Do you believe what you believe is really real?" What you believe shapes all of life. 

- Scripture background from Isaiah 6 - Isaiah sees vision of God on his throne, is convicted of sin, sins forgiven with coal on lips, hears God's call "Who will go for us?" Says "Here am I, send me".

- Isaiah convinced of who God is, compelled to answer the call, committed to the task. Example of responding to God's call.

- 2 Corinthians 5:17-21 - In Christ we are new creations, reconciled to God through Christ. Given ministry of reconciliation to world. We are Christ's ambassadors, pleading for people to be reconciled to God. 

- As ambassadors we represent Christ to world. Need to be convinced, compelled, committed to reconciling others to Christ.

- Shared about 21 years of missionary work in Kenya - church planting, discipleship, community development. Convicted God's word is true, compelled to mission work, committed to ministry there.

- Missionaries invest God's word in people's lives. Everyone an eternal being heading to heaven or hell. Need to share gospel.

- Closed with video "The Distant Boat" - "I should not remain indifferent while people perish." Genuine need for missions.

- Encouraged students to explore mission opportunities during Go Week, be open to God's leading. Asked if convinced, compelled, committed to gospel.
