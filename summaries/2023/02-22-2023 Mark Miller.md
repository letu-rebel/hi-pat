# Summary of Chapel Speaker's Presentation

The speaker, Mark Miller, opened by sharing that the key message for his talk is: 

"Surrendering everything to Jesus leads to your greatest joy." 

He explained that if we are not satisfied or disappointed with the Christian life, it's likely because there is something we haven't fully surrendered to God. Jesus wants to give us an abundant, joyful life. 

Miller then told the story of the Rich Young Ruler from the gospels, who followed all the commandments but still felt something was lacking. Jesus looked at him with love, and told him to sell all he had and give to the poor. But the young man went away sad, unable to let go of his possessions. 

The speaker shared his own story of surrendering his career plans to follow God's call, first to California and then to India as a missionary. He spoke of the joy, friendships, and adventure he experienced that he would not have traded for anything. 

Miller explained that surrender is an ongoing daily process, not just a one-time event. While it may seem impossible, with God all things are possible. Jesus assures us that anyone who has left things behind for His sake will receive a hundredfold in return. 

In closing, he challenged students to surrender everything to Christ, as He is worth far more than anything left behind. Just as Jesus surrendered His life for our joy, surrendering to Him leads to our greatest joy.
