# Speaker Presentation Summary

The speaker for this chapel service was Dr. Mark Cortez from Wheaton College. His presentation focused on the biblical story of Balaam and his donkey from Numbers 22. 

## Overview of the Balaam and Donkey Story
- King Balak of Moab sends messengers to summon the prophet Balaam to curse the Israelites
- God first tells Balaam not to go, but later allows him to go
- As Balaam is traveling, God sends an angel with a sword to block his path
- Balaam can't see the angel, but his donkey can and veers off the road to avoid the angel
- Balaam beats the donkey to get it back on the road
- This happens three times until finally Balaam sees the angel 
- God eventually allows Balaam to continue his journey
- When Balaam arrives, instead of cursing Israel as Balak wanted, he blesses Israel

## Two Key Points from the Story
1. God's actions in the story are unusual 
   - God first tells Balaam not to go, then allows him to go
   - God gets angry when Balaam goes, even though He allowed it
   - The changes in God's instructions emphasize the importance of Balaam speaking God's message correctly
2. God uses unexpected voices (like Balaam's donkey) to convey His message
   - The donkey sees the angel and speaks to Balaam
   - This grabs Balaam's attention to hear God's message

## God's Message to Israel through Balaam
- Israel is blessed because they belong to God 
- God is faithful and will not revoke His blessing
- Israel has a glorious future in God's promises

## Application 
- We can fail to remember core truths like "we are blessed because we are His"
- Be open to God using unexpected means (like a difficult class) to convey His message
- Actively look for God's voice in unexpected places

The presentation aimed to highlight the unexpected ways God communicates and remind the audience of core biblical truths through examining this peculiar Old Testament narrative.
